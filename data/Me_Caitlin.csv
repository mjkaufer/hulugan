"Me","","Hey Caitlin it's Matt!! Sorry for big delay work was (is 💀) v chaotic today

Also before I show you my decor, are you hip to the painting of the guy on the bridge with the scream face like 😱","2021-08-12 00:48:15",,

"Caitlin","2132487674","Hi!! Ugh I'm sorry to hear that😭What do you do for work? 

Yes I think I'm familiar with that painting! 

Spotify IS the only media that matters!! Most of the time it tells me more about a person than their IG could 🧐 definitely says more about compatibility! ","2021-08-12 01:18:13",,
"Me","","I work at a startup that does data labeling for machine learning! (Another hole in my SF cliche punch card 😭 but at least I'm self aware) the people here are v smart/fun but the work is v hectic sometimes

Ok excellent without context it might've been more jarring - ok brace yourself for exhibit A","2021-08-12 01:25:33",,

"Caitlin","2132487674","You get bonus points for not having an insta full of bro trips and shirtless gym selfies 👏 my IG prob contributed to my basicness a little more... 

Start ups are such a fun experience (overall) I totally know what you mean, I worked on a start up all last year - hectic is the only way to describe it! I concentrated in entrepreneurship in college so I'm all about that innovative energy! 

Omg that's a dope piece did you come up with that? I feel like I can't unsee it... 😂 hit me with the next one ","2021-08-12 01:55:59",,"http://69.78.64.23/servlets/mms?message-id=0CEF89D81BA500007910000201"
"Me","","Ya I heard pics holding a fish is the guy cliche, so gotta go out of my way to avoid that haha - also your insta isn't that basic! There are no astrology things or healing crystals as far as I can tell, so that puts you a step above a lot of the other contenders for Ms. Basic 2021!!

Oh nice! Can you call yourself a real entrepreneur if you don't unironically post condescending/self-lauding posts on LinkedIn tho 😤?? Would you say your company's startup sized, or is it a lil bigger?

Ya we had a ukulele painting event at work and I was tryna think of the goofiest thing I could make haha

Ok prepare yourself for round 2","2021-08-12 02:10:14",,

Im not going to lie my LinkedIn is a little neglected, I'm not v proud of my profile 😰 but what do you mean when you asked if the start up was sized?!!

Ukulele painted event? Your work sounds awesome if they put on events like that! Sooo important for bonding and moral. Is that Kanye mimicking Kim K'a iconic champagne Photoshoot? Your collection tells a really interesting story🧐 

No Christmas lights at my house but we do have some dope color changing LED which is v college but I actually love 🤫 in my room I have some concert posters in addition to some black and white shots of my fav artists framed!

"Me","","Ya making big strides towards non basicness, proud of us

Neglected LinkedIn is good haha I feel like LinkedIn is actually the most toxic social media platform, just nonstop humblebragging! O I was asking if your company feels very big/corporate or smaller/startupy!

Ya we have slime making today too so we'll see how that goes haha - they treat us ok every once in a while

Ya it's my favorite painting haha - there's an artist online who paints famous people with pancakes, and I guess Kanye made the cut

Oo color changing led is a step up from Christmas lights, nice! We just got some for our apt today too!

Did you take the B/W shots yourself / are you big into photography? Also what big names have the pleasure of hanging on your wall??","2021-08-12 12:50:10",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","I never thought of it that way... linked in is def a who's Dick is bigger competition, especially post grad. I'm not working the start up anymore but our team never got bigger than 20ish. Fun fact, PG&E isn't in the business of fire suppression- dispute the fact that they've caused and contribute to some of the most deadly fires in history...I did a lot of customer development as CMO🙃 

Slime?! I'm so jealous, is that related to the company or just a fun activity? Tell me more about your company! I'll sign an NDA if I have to 🤫 

The Kanye painting is pretty inspiring, I need to collect some more art. I am super into photography and I wish I got to shoot w Elvis and The Beatles but life had other plans for me 😓 I have some Bad Suns tour art also framed in my room (they're my fav band).  

Are you copying me?!? LED lights are so fun, idc what anyone says. They definitely make a room more interesting, I'm all about that ambiance 🤌

"Me","","Oh nice 20 is a lit size, do y'all do fun offsites and bonding?

Holy moly that is a military grade burn haha, I'm gonna buy stocks in ice packs after that one! Ya I feel like every fortune 500 has some nefarious past, but ya that fire stuff is p messed up damn

Also rip at slime making we just ended up talking about burgers 💀 but ya it was an intern event, but I'm friends with the person who sets up these events so she cuts me in if I lead the events, good friendly collusion

Haha no NDA required - to make AI, computers need lots of examples - like if you wanna teach a baby what a dog is you gotta show it lots of dog pics, and if you show it a cat pic and say dog it will get confused! Same with self driving cars! You gotta give it good examples to help it learn, so our company builds labeling software + global workforce to label this data! 

Rip you call always go to Vegas if you have Elvis photo fomo, they grow on trees down there haha - what kinda stuff do you like to photograph?

I think the only bad suns song I know is cardiac arrest rip #fakeFan - any recs?

Haha yes you caught me red handed, just added a poster of Elvis and the beatles to my shopping cart

The googly eyes have me DEAD, it oozes class, please tell me Elvis has a pair too??","2021-08-12 20:45:39",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","We started peak covid and since we were all remote we never got all officially together :( and im no longer working with them! 

Did you make any burgers w all that talk?! Got to distracted talking about burgers to make slime? You're life sounds pretty great 😅

Woaaahhh that's probably the best explanation of AI I've ever had! Have you ever thought about becoming a teacher 🤓 it seems like you're in the right place.

Also I have to compliment your punctuation, it makes reading your texts so much make conversational. It's like I can translate the tone! 

I haven't played w my camera in awhile but back in the day I loved portraits and landscape!  

At least you know a song 😜 oh god yes I have tooo many recs. Just listen to their sophomore album Disappear Here -like 100x - and you'll almost be as obsessed as me... 😋

Elvis does not have a pair, sorry to disappoint 😕

"Me","","Rip starting in covid must've been rough! Did you amass any fire zoom backgrounds?? 

No burgers were made rip but ya Thursday was pretty chill haha - today will be less chill bc we're throwing our housewarming today, so lots of scrambling about! Does your company do anything to boost morale, or do y'all power through the work week unassisted? I think techies are babied a lil haha

Glad it was helpful! I did a lot of teaching stuff in hs and college, I definitely enjoy it (but idk if I could live in sf if I was on a teacher's salary, rip the state of our education system 💀 also I feel like teaching college kids would be more fun but then you gotta grind in academia which is also a lil extra for me)

Piling on the compliments today haha thank you 🙇 - I'm a sucker for using dashes! 

I am bumping Disappear Here as I write this! I'm sure I'll have their discography tattooed on my back by the end of the listen sesh 😎","2021-08-13 13:48:04",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","Actually we did accumulate a few zoom backgrounds that really took our senior project to that start up level 😏

The company im with now is super small and remote... and my dads the boss😂 so do Dodger games count as company bonding? One of my friends who works for twitch is soooo babied. He gets packages from them like every week packed w cool stuff it's insane! 

Ugh every year I get older the more passionate I get about teachers salary. They really put this country on their back raising children👏 not gonna lie I've thought about teaching... summers off is a big deal!!

Rip now I want weekly goodybags - the grass is always greener I guess haha

True summers off would be so nice! But dealing with high schoolers every day makes it well deserved

I listened to the album on repeat while working, it was good! Is it bad if the songs all blend together? Or maybe that just means the album is put together well

A wall full of good boys and girls :') did you get yours featured?? Also is your map of SF constructed based off of Philz locations? I use boba guys to orient my friends sometimes haha","2021-08-13 19:20:15",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","Working w my dad has its perks but our work- life relationship isn't very balanced. Work always seems to come up in convo and I'm sittin there like, I'm not on the clock for dis rn 😅 A big plus is that there's not a lot of pressure and I have a lot of freedom w the projects he assigns me which I'm thankful for. Buuuut it's remote and I make my own schedule so my self control is constantly being tested 🥵 

I'm glad you enjoyed it! I think it's a great thing bc not a lot of albums can do that! The sequence of the songs was intentional,making the theme of the album pretty clear. Not to be biased or anything- but I do think their ability to blend x amount of songs together, introduce many different ideas, and making listeners put it on repeat says something pretty special😏 other albums that do this really well IMO is Circles by Mac Miller and the new Tyler, the Creator album! 

Blake isn't on the wall yet but she has an entire IG account dedicated to her @blakethecorgi32 - she wanted to let the other pups have their time to ✨All of the Philz in the city def are all landmarks in my book 😍

I am a big mac miller fan too! But I only got into him after he was dead rip

Ya ya wouldn't be fair for the other dogs if Blake were to one up them like that 😤😤😤

Nooo haha losing my voice is the worst - what kinda sick joy do you get from having to speak like a person from an anti smoking ad??

Oh my gosh yes- I love that thing, it really humbled me. Have you tried the music compatibility test? Or the blend feature on Spotify?

When I lose my voice I feel like I did something right bc it usually is the aftermath of a good time! Plus it's kinda ~sexi~ (just me? Ok..) 

Have you thought about marketing bc that's some quality content right there. OMG Mojitos are my summer drink I'm OBsesssed!! What's a painkiller?

Wbu, what's your fav season?!

Vegan sushi yuuuuum! I love a good veggie avocado roll. SLO is a lot smaller than SF so they don't have much more. But they do have a bomb vegan take out place called Ziggys, they have this fried cauliflower salad and ratchet fries (impossible meat w guac, vegan cheese, and their secret sauce) that is TO DIE FOR. Also slodoco, a 24 hour donut shop, puts SLO on the map 👀

I might have to stop by the Indian Pizza place on my way out of town tomorrow- I don't wanna leave!! :(

"Me","","Ya the other great thing about the holidays is that nobody does anything in q4 :') 

Haha no I had to think long and hard about PSL, definitely didn't immediately pop in my head 👀 I think boba guys has a Care Bear collab rn, quite the ambitious crossover, but I'll keep my eye out for pumpkin stuff too

Ya winter is the ez winner for me too, honorable mention to fall, since I think technically pumpkin pies are their domain

Ooooo I'm a big sucker for a 24hr donut shop! Also I checked out their site, looks v v v tasty 😋 everything in SF closes too early 😩 Also I could definitely use some ratchet fries - if it's vegan that means it has to be healthy, right?

Ya hit it up, lemme know if it still holds up to the hype! I'm looking at their website and getting actively hungry 😭 ","2021-08-18 18:18:34",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","That's definitely another plus for the holidays! Will your work give you some time off? 

Care bear!! Omg those sound like they'd be good! Have you tried any of those flavors yet? I'm sure there's a homemade recipe online somewhere for pumpkin boba 🧋 

Slodoco also has dome vegan donut options, cherry choc chip is my fav 😍 ummm I tell myself that if it's vegan it's def healthier but idk how true that really is 🤫","2021-08-19 12:41:57",,
"Me","","We have ""unlimited pto"" but I feel like nobody used it 💀 but I always take a week or two off around then for Christmas with the fam! I gotta squeeze a few snowboard trips in too since I got the epic pass! Do you have any fun vaca on the horizon?? Have you been making good use of pto or have you been stuck w/ work

No I'm too basic, I'm strawberry matcha latte ride or die 😤 also I didn't know they finally added the boba emoji!!! A big step towards acknowledging boba superiority over ☕

All I know is that oreos are vegan, so I can eat them guilt free 😎","2021-08-19 17:48:29",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","That's an interesting work life balance haha but at least you can use it all at once! Where's the fam located? Snowboarding is sooo much fun- I visited Telluride CO last winter break and it was beautiful! My cousin is getting married next month in AZ and best friend just moved out there with her husband so I'm going to visit her also! I don't really have a pto deal 😭 but I make my own schedule essentially so that's a plus

That sounds so refreshing-it's been so hot in SLO. I'm def gonna get one when I come back to SF! Also prob a dumb question buuuuuut how do you have all for the iPhone emojis if you don't have an iPhone (assuming since our texts are green 😩) 

Oreos are most def vegan and one of my go to desserts 😋 lately I've been making apple nachos!

"Me","","Fam is east coast! Used to be VA, now in DE! Extended fam in NY and NJ tho so I'm perfecting my Jersey Italian accent haha 🤌 🍅

Glad to hear you are a snowboarder and not a skiier 😤 Telluride is supposed to be really nice, right??

Ooo lit are you a bridesmaid?? Sounds like it'll be a fun time out there! Making own schedule is always a win in my book!

Dude I love SF weather so much, I just wear tshirt + pants + flannel every day, no need to check the weather channel!! Seasons are overrated (except for the TJ flavors ofc)

I am a normie android user :((( but ya I'm shook that I got the boba emoji and not a big empty square!! The future is truly now - thank you for not discriminating against my green messages 😩💚

What the heck is an apple nacho?? Sounds v sacrilegious, but I'm ready to learn more haha","2021-08-20 03:16:51",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","I have some family in upstate NY that I used to visit every summer and sometimes hit up nyc w my dad! I really want to explore more of the east coast tho! 

I first learned to ski and then snowboard and tbh I like both just as much 🤫 snowboarding is  def 10x cooler tho 😎

Telluride is very very nice! It's like a winter wonderland up there- but with lots of rich people 

I'm not in this wedding but I was a maid of honor for my first wedding in June. So I'm excited to experience it from the other side! Yeah I shouldn't be complaining, but as someone who can't say no to anything and is very easily distracted it's a challenge 😂 

SF is amazing but that's all of CA! SLO is known for the best weather - a solid 72 year round! I'm def one of those that is cold when it's 65 outside 🥶 since we don't really have all the seasons in CA, the TJs seasonal items are the only thing that get me into the mood! 

Btw today I did this hike and felt like a rock climber- i see the hype around rock climbing gyms now!

I'd never discriminate against android users! @ anyone who complains about the green messages is cray-Z bc who doesn't love the color green?! 🤑 I am curious as to why you've decided you're too cool for iPhones tho 😉

Sacrilegious 😂 you slice an apple thin then apply whatever toppings you want. My go to dressings are pb, honey, carob chips, and cinnamon 🤤

"Me","","O lit good family bonding!! I'm going to nyc for first time in a bit in a few months, lemme know if you have any recs from last time you were there!

Ya I was the same, skiied v briefly but then saw the light 😎🏂

Honestly name a ski resort without rich people 🤔

Maid of honor!!! Really getting thrown in the deep end for your first wedding haha, was it family or close friend? Did you have to deal with any bridezilla energy?

72 is pushing it tbh, how will I wear my tech bro flannels 😩

Oo was it like a hike with scrambles / where you're going up and over boulders?? Those are my fav 😍 yes welcome to the climbing community! I injured my fingers the other day so I've gotta take like a month long break 😭 I have extreme fomo rn, but if you ever wanna learn the ropes (no pun intended) hmu!

I think I'm pretty tech savvy, but if my phone doesn't have a back button I feel like a boomer and I can't do anything lol - now the iphones have 0 buttons right?? Also the price point is v nice. Plus that would be the nail in the basic girl coffin, gotta cling on to hope with the android haha

Ok actually I am a big sucker for apple + pb - I thought you were putting cheese on your apples and warming them up haha, had me very shook","2021-08-20 19:44:22",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","Ugh I'm jealous, what for?! bfast bagel sandwich's and pizza are a must! 

Yeah ikr! It was a lot of responsibility and my BFF was the complete opposite of a bridezilla. It was honestly the best experience, I was so happy to be her maid of honor! 

The tech bro flannel is v necessary- Have you tried tying it around your waist tho?! That's hot af!!! 

It was a lot of climbing over boulders and a steep climb! I will have to check out the climbing gyms to conquer my fears! Matt w the 🔥 puns again- I wouldn't expect anything less

I totally feel you, I still have an iPhone 7. I love my home button and I don't think I'll be able to live without one. The Android is v cool bro tech energy > basic girl energy. you have life all figured out now 😜

Ewwww you were so nice about that, I'd be so concerned if people made apple nachos like that. You should try out my recipe sometime 😋 also- vegan cheese doesn't melt very easily :(

"Me","","Just hanging w some friends who are out there for the week! True I will definitely be going hard on the bagels! And Michael Scott tells me that sbarro is the place to go for an authentic nyc slice

Nice, glad it was a good experience! Did you give a 🔥 speech??

I guess I've only scratched the tip of the flannel iceberg since I never really do the waist thing haha - I wonder what other secret flannel techniques there are 🤔

I like steep climbs on the way up, but hate them on the way down, I always feel like I'm gonna fall! Ya I'd say despite the climbing, I still have a fear of heights, but I've learned to just not look down lol

Wow iphone 7 has been going strong! Ya I feel like there are two tech archetypes, the tech hipster and the tech nerd (which both kinda fall under tech bro umbrella) - I think the tech hipster is more apple, and the tech nerd is more android! Are there other sub-archetypes of basic girls? I've heard of hey girl vs bruh girl

Ya ya I will bring back the apple nachos into my diet! I feel like one with nature when I eat them

Also me and my co-workers went to Berkeley last night and I was in charge of the car tunes, and I played our summer playlist and everybody was vibing, our taste in music has been validated!!","2021-08-21 11:50:43",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","I hear NYC is poppin rn plus going during the winter is one of the best ways to experience the city IMO! Omg on a scale of 1-10 how much do you stan the office??

I was supposed to be the only one giving a speech so the pressure was on- but I got the crowd goin and more people said a few words. You could say I set the bar pretty high 😎

Same here! That's what I hate most about steep hikes, it's so scary on the way down. There's this hike called Avila ridge near my house and the only way down is to slide on your butt- it's that steep😰Im also kinda scared of heights but I love flying in planes! I thought about being a flight attendant after graduation 👀 

My iPhone 7 and Apple Watch 1st generation are still puttin in thag werk for me- I can't give up on them yet. I def agree w your take on the tech archetypes, early adopters fit somewhere in there forsure! 

Girls have sooooo many different archetypes! Hey girl and bruh girl are the main groups but there are other subgroups- like the ""that girl"", surfer chick , hipster girl, witchy girl, sk8r girl, and the iconic baddie. 

Omg that makes me so happy! That's the best feeling when you get everyone goin w your jams!Look at us 😎 I've been adding more songs to it recently! And the other night I had a burst of creative energy and renamed a bunch of my playlists and moved things around at like 1am

"Me","","Haha I watched it long ago, would say like a solid 3/10, but big fan of the references, they transcend culture

Wow excellent maid-of-honoring!! Get those glasses clinking 😤

Butt sliding hikes are cancelled 🙅 but also flight attendant would've been a sweet gig, what changed?

Wow a true OG apple fangirl, has tim cook come to shake your hand personally?

Ok I think I'm out of the loop on the other archetypes haha - is witchy girl the same as goth gf? Also how is baddie different from sk8r girl? Did you have any phases? I feel like middle school is when the most spicy phases make themselves known

Oh no don't tell me you renamed picnic at the disco!! ","2021-08-21 23:34:29",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","I love the office so much... that shit hurted a little 

The flight attendant gig is kinda a backup plan and I really put it on the burner since covid 🤭 

Tbh I used to watch the keynotes of iOS updates and product releases in like 2011 before they were cool. Am I nerdy yet?? The year I got an iPod nano for Christmas changed my life forever- no joke 🤯

No no no, witchy is like the crystals- astrological- Terro card girls. A baddie is like influencer IG girl. A sk8r girl wears ripped jeans, vans, and crop tops. I didnt go through a lot of phases but def aligned more as a tom boy and played a lot of sports! What phases did you go through? 

I could never come up w a better name than Panic! At the Disco 🕺🏻

"Me","","How many times have you watched through it now?? I know some people put it on in the background as white noise too

Ya sometimes when I am fed up with work I just think, what if I move to a random farm and live a peaceful agricultural life :') but I don't think that will ever happen either rip

You are a true tech hipster!! Surprised I haven't seen pics of you in a black turtleneck alongside Steve Jobs! I remember my first ipod shuffle, that was lit!! Also tbt the ipod touch and all those wonderful app store apps, truly simpler times

Oh I think a synonym for witchy I've heard a lot is astrology hoe (also I usually hear baddie referred to as insta hoe, but I think your terms are a lil friendlier)

I don't think I had any distinct phases, but I remember middle school matthew wearing exclusively plaid shorts (and now I wear exclusively flannel tops so the cycle is compete) - I also had a big watch phase (like, literally, the watches were big haha), but the year is 2021 and now we all have watches in our pockets

Any honorable mentions from the great playlist revolution?","2021-08-22 15:09:37",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","Probably 3 times! It got me through some dark days- it's one of the only shows that makes me actually lol as I'm half asleep watching it! 

With the way work life is moving more towards the remote direction maybe one day you will- you can have it all!! What's your dream job??

Yes iPod touch's were the coolest thing ever, I always played angry birds, cut the rope, jungle run, and sims! 

Yessss those are def the same archetypes, I guess maybe I'm a little nicer than you?? 😮‍💨😝

I clearly remember owning a pair of plaid shorts in elementary school and setting trends like colored skinny jeans w tall crazy socks and clear converse 💁🏼‍♀️ haha I totally remember the kids w the big watches, did you have a roller backpack too?😉

I'm glad you asked 😍 I created playlists: pop princess and garage band both of which are baby playlists- so young they just learned to sit up. Then I renamed my Christmas playlist to Buddy the elf, what's ur fav color? My classics playlist to melt (bc the songs make me weak at the knees). My throwback playlist to oldie but a goodie. My 😎 playlist to ice cold la croix (bc it's the music I hear when I drink la croix-  for more context a psychedelic beach pop indie mess). Then I renamed Bruh to Mike's Mix (music that reminds me of my lil brother Luke- Mike which js nickname which is another story). My playlist Soo Chill is now called spiral (bc I literally see this emoji when I listen to it 🌀 ). Last but not least Summer Dream is now titled dreamcicle (bc u have to admit it's just way sexier 🤤). I know you asked for honorable mentions but they all deserve some recognition IMO!!

"Me","","Oh I feel like 3 isn't that bad! I was expecting double digits from you 😛 but ya it's nice to have a show you can just reliably kick back to!

Haha we will see - I think teaching would be v fun, but also I don't wanna go back to school for a teaching degree 😩 wbu??

Wow I got so much nostalgia reading that, those were such classics! Also the hunt for free WiFi was another classic in that pre-3g world

Ya you got me there 😩 

Caitlin the middle school fashion icon!!! You can bring the look back tbh (also I didn't know clear converses were a thing but makes sense if you're tryna flex those socks 😤)

I've never been so offended, roller backpack is the lowest tier on the middle school social hierarchy 😠 

Elf is such a classic movie tbh, my dad has a buddy the elf costume and dresses up as him during the Christmas 5k by us (to stand out from all of the Santa sheeple)

I like all the creativity in the names!! Also ice cold lacroix sounds like a nice summer vibe, I'll spotify stalk that one first! You could always make a whiteclaw spinoff that's even more psychedelic, if that's possible

Haha so it seems like this need to rename things isn't just limited to spotify playlists, with the Luke/Mike switcharoo - story time??

Thank you for hosting the Ted talk, I like the creative energy! If you had to give a Ted talk, what'd it be about??","2021-08-22 22:43:08",,

What grade/subject would you wanna teach? I think science would be super fun! 

Yesss I would do anything for that wifi connection when I was younger! 

Thanks Matt I'm glad someone appreciated my vision 🤩
Clear converse we sooooo sick. 10/10 would recommend

Hey hey I had a roller backpack one year 😂😂😂

You're dad is a trend setting too! Elf is one of my fav movies- def fav Christmas movie. I pretty much know all of the words!

White claw is such a genius name, I might steal it 😘 that makes me think of a sorority girl playlist- sooo like summer top 100 aka the most basic playlists of them all

My brother rebranded in middle school and changed his name to Mike after he and our cousin made a character on some fighting game. it started w just his close friends and then everyone at our school started calling him it as a joke- but no one knew why he chose the name Mike and it drove people nuts

I'm glad you enjoyed it- compliments are nice but tips are better 🤑 if I gave a real ted talk it would def be about music and probably something similar tbh! I don't think I've seen one of those yet. Wbu? 

Also- have you seen any ted talks that changed your life 😱

"Me","","Who's your spirit-character from the office? I've watched breaking bad twice through, but I think that's the only series I've seen a second time!

Oo I think math + computer science is actually very fun to teach & has a lot of ways to make it more interactive / creative than it currently is! But ya science would be cool to do all those experiments to blow the kids' minds! I feel like junior year in HS is a good year, or sophomore in college! Avoid the freshman antics and senioritis!!

Ya they sound cool, but are they heelys level cool?? Full disclosure I was not cool enough for heelys, but one of my friends got a pair in college to relive his glory days as an elementary schooler

Also the roller backpack is a big red flag 🚨🚨🚨 was this elementary, middle, or high school? The answer here is very important 👀

My fav elf line is when he tells mall santa he smells like meat and cheese, but ya that whole movie is a classic!

Oo ya that would be a good use of whiteclaw!! Hmu if the playlist becomes a reality!

Wow that rebrand is alpha af, what a man of mystery! Although I guess in fairness he only changed half of his first name haha - do you call him Luke or Mike?

I think emoji are super fun / interesting! I don't know what I'd talk about in particular, but emoji tech talk would be the move 😤 maybe something about how emoji are interpreted differently across culture! I read an interesting paper a while back about how people perceive emoji meaning different across different phones, since the icons are slightly different too!

I don't think I've had my life outlook altered by any, but a friend of mine gave a ted talk when he was 12 haha which made me feel incredibly flexed on haha - what about you??","2021-08-23 20:29:29",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","I really am Jim bc when people are doing dumb shit I find myself looking into an imaginary camera and thinking 🤔 wtf. I've never seen breaking bad but that's another popular one! What do you like about it? 

I wouldn't trust myself to teach math bc it never came naturally to me- but it's such an important subject that demands a good teacher. I've had some evil math teachers growing up who got off on making kids feel stupid... so weird 

Omg I loveeeeed my Heelys. They were kinda dangerous tho, I remember they were banned from my school- but a few of us snuck them anyway 😎

Roller backpacks are a red flag 🚩 I think I was in 3rd grade? This is prob gonna sound weird but I remember doing it as an experiment to see what it felt like to be a nerdy kid- low key I thought they were cool af and I wanted to be really smart 

I just thought of a better name... whiteclaw wasted. What do ya think 😜

I did call him Mike for a hot minute there while I dated someone named Luke 🥴 there was a time when I had 3 Lukes v close to me haha

The emoji tech talk theory is real!!! I've thought about it also- it's so fascinating! I'd def come to your Ted talk 😊 if you find the paper send it over I'd love to read it! 

Whaaaat at 12?! What did they talk about? Pls send me the video I've gotta see this! 

One night I feel into a hole of videos about how our brain falls in love and other research about how humans connect w each other- which led me to question why I didn't study psychology more in school bc I loved it so much.

"Me","","I totally feel that Jim vibe when somebody does something goofy haha, recently work has given me some Stanley level look-into-camera moments tbh

Breaking bad has a cool plot, really good music, mice cinematography, and a cast of characters you get really attached to!! You should check it out - also better call saul is basically a big prequel to it which is also super cool

Oh ya some teachers are big meanies 😠 any iconic stories from back in the day? I had one teacher who, when nobody was answering, said ""I wish you all were chickens, because at least I'd have some eggs""

Heelys and roller backpack?? That's a lot of wheels holy moly - also ok 3rd grade is an understandable time for a roller backpack 👀 did your report card get boosted after??

Ya whiteclaw wasted truly captures the spirit of the playlist, 10/10!

Haha I like the tactical name swap from you, ya that's a lot of Lukes for sure!

I just re-found it! Search for ""varying interpretations of emoji Miller"" and it should come up, I don't like reading words but they have some good graphs you can scroll to!

https://youtu.be/Fkd9TWUtFm0 here is the Ted talk haha it's basically a super flex - he's started his own company since, v wild, but super nice wholesome dude

Teachers felt comfortable picking on me in class for some reason so I got a lot of shit😂 some say it's bc they know I can handle it but it got old sometimes. One teacher my junior year used to ask me ""where do you get your clothes? The baby gap?!"" And that sucked bc I was super insecure w my size already 🙄

Sadly my grades didn't get the dramatic boost that I wished for-def not that app developer success your friend had at 12! Just watched his ted talk w my friend, what really impressed me was ability to communicate his philosophy behind app developing. Not only did he know multiple coding languages but he was trying to teach them, thats another level of intelligence dude!! 

Thanks for digging that article up for me! I'm the same way- biiiig graph girl here. In fact I'm kinnda obsessed w visual representations of data. My dad told me that when I was little I would pull out his stock chart reports and read them... w confidence 😝

You haveeee to agree that apple emojis are more visually pleasing than the other devices by far! LG and a Samsung are just baaaad 

It was one of my favorite classes! We learned a lot about how to conduct a good interview (you'd be surprised how important it is to phrase questions and not ask leading questions- which can misrepresent the data you're collecting) this came in handy for customer development which was my focus senior year and played a big role in my senior project!

I feel like my taste in video is actually pretty low bar, I'll watch almost anything / don't get bored easy, but ya I think BB is a cut above! How's The Chair? Does it sit well with you? Does it have a leg up on other series? Does the chair rock?

Dang that's pretty messed up :( did you ever hit them back with a 🔥 counter roast? 

And he had the puns too with bustin jieber haha - fun fact he would wear Google glass around campus at all times, and there's a professor who does the same, and they ended up doing research together, it was v cute and wholesome 

That mental image is so adorable haha - did you tell your dad ""buy the dip, always hold""? If I've learned anything from working, saying stuff with confidence is half the battle, maybe you will pivot to the wonderful world of wall street - have you heard of /r/wallstreetbets?

Ya ya I'll give you that one - I'm on a Google pixel and the emojis are p cute tho I gotta say - also that reminded me of a good emoji meme, will send it when I find it!

The Chair had all 4 legs and def rocks 😉 it gives me all my dreams of east coast small liberal arts college in the winter- v academia v Campus by Vampire Weekend energy #iykyk 

I fought back w my ""pranks"", a group of us in ASB were doing senior pranks when we were juniors in attempt to frame the senior class (it worked). But those interactions w teachers made me more witty and sassy af (which already comes naturally 💁🏼‍♀️) but did help me pull some clout w teachers when I needed extra time on tests/assignments- I'm v slow on tests. It's like my brain decides to go on vaca when I need it most!

Are you a big Reddit guy? Im guilty of the occasional bachelor nation gossip and vegan fitness channels 🥸

I'm glad you asked 😜 my senior project was a start up called Perch Sensing! A group of engineering students and I worked on bringing an iOT device to market all last year. It was really exciting, frustrating, and challenging- v basic start up energy but I loved it!

Wow yes I like the page for the raw chaotic energy it exudes haha - have you successfully infiltrated their ranks to market to them? I dabble on reddit haha, usually subs with goofy memes and the like - is this season a good bachelor season??

""Investor owned"" utilities sounds a lot more concerning than ""business owned"" utilities haha - what dirt did you uncover?? Also holy moly that's a lot of interviews

Vampire Weekend is v nostalgic to me, grew up listening to alt nation on Sirus XM radio- they were one of my first bands I remember loving. Do you have a fav album? Also, they're great in concert 😍

The best prank was prob my senior year when a few of us from the volleyball team TPd (🧻) some football players houses from our school and framed our rival school the night before the big homecoming game 🤠 

Testing anxiety is real, mine seemed to escalate as other students finished before me😰

I haven't infiltrated the stock bros -yet but a storms a brewin 😤 as for the bachelorette... this season was not my fav. Tbh I know it's trash tv but it's basically an excuse for my bffs and I to get together and shit talk and fall in love w attractive people! Do you have any guilty pleasure shows? 

You've hit the nail on the head! IOW (investor owned utilities) are trash af! PG&E and other power utilities in CA literally told me that they aren't in the business of fire suppression... wtf! So they dgaf about the damage they're causing and aren't interested in real solutions.

Ya I was big into alt rock growing up too! Lots of vw, strokes, cage the elephant, weezer, the works! Before that though I used to listen to lots of queen, Johnny cash, and Elvis, because those were the only cds we had in the car haha

I think their self titled is most nostalgic for me! Now I'm gonna binge listen VW - also ya I'm sure they're a hoot live! When did you see them?

That's genius, did your football team do better because they were all riled up??

Ya I used to enjoy finishing tests early but then one time I forgot a question on the back and have since been super paranoid haha

Keep me posted w the updates 😤 Ya trash tv is fun! My dad would always trash talk my mom/sister watching the bachelor but we'd always catch him sneaking a peak 👀 I feel like I haven't watched too many tv shows recently, but there was a Netflix show called floor is lava which was really dumb but it let me turn my brain off which was nice

Ya I guess there's no I in team but there are a few in utilities 😭 What's the secret to getting the big pg&e head honchos on the line??

My middle school dreams are coming true when I see the strokes in October 😍I recently rediscovered Weezer and made a new playlist w them as the spotlight artist 👀 also a biiiig queen and Elvis fan. Bohemian Rhapsody is one of my fav movies- kinda inspired me to want to work in the entertainment industry with hopes of working on a film like that! 

That's a great album but I think Contra takes the cake for me... by a slice 🧐

That was our main intention and no we lost, but got our butt kicked a little less that year 😼

Everyone loves to hate or hates to love the bachelor- no ones safe! 

Ughhh that pun is so accurate it hurts 😵‍💫 my team was very persistent, lots of jumping through hoops to get these guys to talk to us! I'd say our response rate was 1/50 🤕

Also what's the weezer playlist?? I think the little cover exchange between them and toto was v cute

Ya it's a close call, I was a coinflip between either - also check out a song called ""step to my girl"", it's a rap song that samples step by vw, v interesting!

Ya ya imagine how bad you would've lost without the tp 😤

I had 7 tickets to VW at the SB Bowl- that I couldn't get rid of, wish I knew you when I had them🥺 step to my girl by souls of mischief? Just listened, love when artists nod at other artists especially when they are a totally dif sound/genre. I'm always curious to hear how/who my fav artists draw inspiration from. Some artists have playlists on their Spotify that are filled w their own fav jams- I always look for it! 

You get it 🥲 I like to think my motive was innocent, plus I'll jump at any opportunity to stir the pot a bit😈

The seal emoji is the perf balance of sassy and cute 🦭!!! A v fine line to walk and they executed it perf. Omg I'm totally going to use that little evil box on my worst enemies 😜

😤😎 are v much my vibe most of the time! My emojis are always charged w at least 50% sarcasm. Waaaait do you hate 😂 emoji? I use it often but I feel like it's justified bc im always giggling.

"Me","","O nice, god bless the reschedule 🙏 I didn't see it advertised on the tour page, so maybe they're keeping it a secret for y'all OGs - are you into their newer stuff or are you a sucker for their classics?

It's a bop! The middle is such a big tbt! Ya I really like listening to the songs artists sample from, lots of cool retro stuff - I feel like I never see more modern samples (like VW) so that was v neat to listen to

Ya weezer covered africa, but then toto covered hash pipe, it was v cute, honestly would be so down to see other bands do lil song exchanges with eachother

Ya if only 😭 but also holy moly what's the secret to getting so many super bowl tickets?? 

There's no seal emoji in my keyboard emoji list 😩 but yes haha the box is a powerful weapon! I think I rely on 🙊 for my sassy/cute combo

Ya ofc never do anything 100% unironically, always save at least 1% of sarcasm to squeeze in there

I used to have buying tickets down to a science. Alarms, multiple tabs, the whole deal! I would go crazy for the deals and try to buy as many tickets as I could and resell the extras. But got unlucky w VW bc Ticketmaster has a picky policy 😭

🙊 is v cute when used in the right context... back in the day people misused it IMO which kinda ruined it for me. But I def agree the right amount of sassy and cute. Now that you bring it up 😂 is v boomer culture now, I'll need to rethink my emoji game thanks for dropping some knowledge on me 🥵

The Nintendo ds was such a classic!!! Were you a nintendogs player by any chance? I feel like that would've been up your alley! Also I was never good at guitar hero 😭 but this means you have so much untapped potential to convert your guitar hero skills into real guitar skills 😤

Do you have your vinyls arranged on your wall? I've seen stuff like that before, it's a v cool aesthetic! Also what albums have impacted you?? 

That is so rude 😠 I'm sure it is all muscle from all the butt wiggling she does 🍑 or maybe her hair is just longer than usual - hopefully Blake didn't overhear these wild accusations

"Caitlin","2132487674","Snow days! Ugh I was always jealous of kids who got those. they always looked cool in the movies and maybe if I had a few of those I would’ve learned guitar too🤨 did you have any musician idols?! 

First I had the game boy, ds, and then the dsi(if you aren’t familiar it’s the one w the camera 😛) i def had a few nintendogs games- how’d your know!!! I also loved Pokémon and all the Mario games! I spent a lot of my time traveling when I was little so it was the best way to pass the time 

I’ve always been nervous to hang them on the wall but I do like the look a lot! When I can afford my own place I want a record room with floor pillow, mood lighting, and a dope sound system- w records on display everywhere😍 

Some vinyls that mean a lot to me are AM by Arctic Monekys (v aware that I sound like a tumblr girl but I will take this album to the grave), Coming Home by Leon Bridges, Disappear Here by Bad Suns ofc. some more favs are Hoizer’s self titled album, Come Away With Me by Norah Jones and Sam Cooke’d hits 

She’s totally all muscle from the hills she climbs in the city! We keep her soooo active and take her everywhere w us. Her fluff is a lil extra rn so it’s prob time for a trim. Some people don’t know how to trim her butt- which doesn’t do her justice 🍑 blake has that Lizzo energy and is body positive af 

I’ve never thought of it that way 🤭 she’s def got abbs of steal protected by a layer of fluff 🤗 when she’s not planking she’s on her back workin for the much deserved pets ","2021-08-29 18:29:11",,"http://69.78.81.38/servlets/mms?message-id=01F0EDB342370000C320000201"
"Me","","Haha ya it was so nice to wake up and not have to go in! Did y'all have smoke days or something in cali?

Idt I had any idols, but I liked a lot of John Mayer's playing, v funky / fun to play / cool sounding guitar!

Ya I remember the dsi too! My sister had nintendogs and I never got it because it wasn't masculine enough, but I will admit I might have played it a few times 👀 Also ya Pokemon and Mario were big favs by me too! The Pokemon soundtracks went super hard tbh - were you big into mario kart on the DS? I think that, new super mario bros, and Pokemon diamond were my favs! I actually still have my gba and dsi with me but haven't turned them on in a while 😭

Nervous why? Like afraid of them falling / damaging the vinyl case? 

I am a big fan of the floor pillow aesthetic, very bohemian haha - we just got some mood lighting in our apt, it really classes the place up! Sounds like a super lit record room!

Also ya the dream of cali home ownership is such a struggle 😭 all the houses here in sf are like 80+ years old and going for 7 figures 💀 I really want my own place so I can build a lil climbing wall in the garage (and because paying rent just feels like a big scam)

AM is a classic, no tumblr judgement from me! Also big fan of Hozier's Hozier, listened to him a lot back in the day - I'll check those other albums out! What made you decide to try out vinyl?

Sounds like Blake would make an excellent peloton coach!","2021-08-29 21:19:47",,

Is ninentogs still a threat to your masculinity today 🤭?! It was a super fun game but idk why I spent time taking care of a virtual dog when I had two of my own at home 😅 i played mario cart on the wii and mostly mario party and super mario bros on my ds! I can hear the Pokémon soundtrack in my head rn as we speak 🥲 I also still have my ds and maybe acquired a switch lite during the pandemic as a bday gift to myself 🥳 did you have any crazy pandemic purchases/ hobbies?

Yeah I'm afraid they would fall off the wall and I'd have to replace them, when I would rather just use that money to buy new records! 

Yeah two of my family members have left CA to buy homes in other states. It really sucks bc I'd love to own a home on the coast one day. SF Victorian homes are old but i would still get my hands on one if I could! Omg pls tell me youd give your climbing gym a cool name!! 

I got really into vinyls my senior year of hs when I believed I needed to take my music appreciation to the next level. there's something special about owning physical copies in a digital world- it makes me feel more connected to my fav albums😌also there was a trading post near my house where I would get records for cheep!","2021-08-30 01:16:06",,"http://63.55.1.87/servlets/mms?message-id=0FF0F36282DE00009A50000201"

Haha no no I've transcended that - I even got animal crossing on my switch, with minimal damage to my manliness 😤 wow those are all the classics! And yas #treatyoself What switch games do you have?? I have lots of recs depending on what you like to play!

My best quarantine purchase was a panini press! Now my basic sandwiches taste (and look 😎) 10x better! What abt you, any 🔥 purchases other than your switch?

Ya fair enough, get those records! Anything on the vinyl wishlist?

They sound like smart family members tbh - sometimes I wish all my friends lived somewhere with cheap housing haha but rip they're all here or in nyc 💀

Thanks good news 😌 I just gave animal crossing! But tbh I haven't touched it in a few months so I'm trying to trade it in for some extra cash 🤑

A panini press is a v adult purchase and def ascends any sandwich to a 11/10- idc whag anyone says! I usually spend all my $ on concerts so I didn't have any other crazy purchases besides the switch- unless you count a disney+ subscription 😅

I've had Brothers by The Black Keys and Revolver by The Beatles on my list for awhile!

Uh oh you would think all the romantic songs he sings would be backed with some basis in life 💀

Ya I got a lil tired of animal crossing after the first few hours, felt a lil repetitive, but it's cool to see the stuff other people build! Ya you gotta be like lil dicky and save that money 😤

Ya now I feel grown grown, next stop on the #adult appliances is air fryer 😤 Concert tickets are a good way to go! I was looking at ways to go to outside lands earlier today, tickets are like $600 on stubhub but signups for volunteering were up - think how many panini presses I could buy with that!

Disney+ is one of the artsy fartsy subscriptions! Also peak adulting right there - what do you watch on it / do you think it's worth?

Oo ya those are classics!! Have you been scouring the store for them?

Ooo ok first we gotta introduce some climbing jargon

In bouldering (climbing without ropes), the boulder grades are V + a number, so like V6 or something - so the iconic bouldering pickup line is - if you were a boulder, you'd be a v-cute!

Also on toprope, you belay people, so you can be like ""let's have a belaytionship""

This one is a bit more tasteless, but the climbing holds all have different names, and the big easy to grab ones are called jugs, so you can always go with the ""nice jugs""

Still stumped on gym names tho 😭 need to do more thinking","2021-08-31 00:18:28",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","We used to have to run ""the bleacher mile"" where after every lap around the track we had to run up and down the bleachers. It was the death of me! I was really into running for a few months where some weeks I would get up to 14+ miles! But then I lost a bunch of muscle and now I'm trying to build it back in da gym 💪🏼

My vb career ended after my first year in college, it was a tough season 🥴 I played softball and basketball through high school but tennis and karate didnt make the cut. My dad liked to really keep my brother and I busy on his weekends🥵did you play any sports/ were super competitive w anything growing up? 

Not gonna lie i am a sucker for slow dancing in a burning room, your body is a wonderland, and love on the weekend. Half of my heart and vultures get honorable mention for sure! 

Omg speaking of lil dicky, have you seen his music video for Pillow Talking or his new show on Hulu?! 

Ok ok so one of the main reasons I got Disney+ was to have a MCU marathon w my brother. One of our proud accomplishments during quarantine was watching every movie in order- it was the best idea I've ever had and I would totally do it again🤩 I love going to the movies so black out curtains, snacks, and blasting the AC in my brothers apartment was the next best thing for our marathons. (Im a big MCU fan) 
 I did enjoy Wandavision and Loki too! Plus I got to see Soul and Cruella w premiere access which was totally worth it bc I loved both of those movies so much. Prob my favs this past year!  

Thanks for the lesson on climbing jargon bc I wouldn't have known annnnnny of those 🔥 lines. Have they worked on anyone before?😉

What if you named your gym ""Matt's Pad""? Bc I'm sure there are matts/pads on the floor in the climbing gyms and it's also a nice play on words bc your name obvi 💁🏼‍♀️","2021-08-31 01:18:10",,"http://69.78.32.246/servlets/mms?message-id=06F10787C38C00006E30000201"

Wow quite the jack of all trades!! Was vb your fav of those?? Any alumni softball or basketball matches coming up?? Also your dad sounds like a wise man haha

I played soccer until hs, and did a year of crew freshman year of hs (that shit was ultra tough, lots of bleacher mile energy) but otherwise nothing too crazy! Lots of programming competitions tho, v nerdy lifestyle

One of my favs of his (mostly bc of the 💦 guitar licks) is Sucker (not to be confused with the Jonas brothers' hit!), but it's not on spotify 😭

Pillow talking is such a great song, so many layers, so quotable! I don't think I've seen the music video, but I've seen s1 of Dave, I liked it! I gotta remember to hit up s2 on hulu!

That is so wholesome, sounds v worth! I think I'd be binging the mandolorian if I had D+, and Loki looked really interesting too! Did you watch the MCU movies in order of release date, or in order of their place in the timeline?

Believe it or not they have not haha - they are reserved for goofing around with my friends - they are far too powerful to be used in the real world

There was also free food 😍 I think the coolest things I worked on were VR bowling and, if you remember in star wars when Luke was training on the lil droid shooting lasers at him, a vr game of that - but ya tl;dr, 10/10 wholesomeness, 1/10 on hotness, lots of sweaty tech bros

I feel like you would be a very good marketer considering how strong your pun game is! I'll keep ya posted!

"Caitlin","2132487674","Those events sound like a lot of fun! I wish I was exposed to programming when I was younger I totally would've been downnnn w that crowd! Did you work in teams or individually? Also- what's ""tl;dr""? Pls educate me I'm just a business student 😩 I grew up w 3 Star Wars stans for brothers so I totally appreciate your work! 

This is baby John Mayer! kinda miss this era :,) 

Omg I just watched the lion king rap- lil dicky is such a good story teller. This is like the spark notes version. He should do more- it would save me a lot of time bc I watch so many movies 😅 something about his voice in this is kinda hard to listen to tho- v monotone. Still a 10/10 for creativity 

It most def is the ratio that makes all the girls go 😍 I want to go to Disneyland and see the new Star Wars installation soooo bad, I haven't been since I was 15! 

Guardians of the Galaxy changed the game for the MCU script- it stands out for its sound track and punchy comedic lines that the characters deliver. Rocket is amazing 😻 I highly recommend watching Wandavisiona Loki! I def have a women crush on Scarjo- she's so badass! But my fav is prob Captain America 🤤 do you have a fav character? 

You're such a good friend omg this is amazing- should I shoot him an email? 😜 hes prob still single bc this site is such a threat😚 

I made the graphics and business concept for a project my junior year- prob one of the most fun assignments! Learning Adobe InDesign and Illustrator was almost the death of me tho. The most coding I've ever done was some html and css stuff but I loved it a lot and was v proud lololol https://cmaltbie.github.io/zany.github.io/ - it looks better on a desktop FYI🤓 

I just got an email about working outside lands!!! You should totally volunteer! ","2021-08-31 16:36:47",,"http://63.55.128.103/servlets/mms?message-id=07F1145D04930000C4A0000201"
"Me","","Ya what could've been! Usually worked with the buds, more fun that way! Tl;dr = too long: didn't read, basically an ez way to summarize something! Did their appreciation of star wars rub off on you?? Or were you an unphased sith-ster 🤓

Haha ya he really captured the essence of the movie in like five minutes! I'd totally subscribe to LD movie recaps 🎬 what's up next on your list of movies to watch? I haven't watched a lot lately because I feel like they're too long, but I have no problem binging tv episodes for hours on end so something isn't adding up 🤔

I miss Disneyland! I think the pirates of the caribbean ride was my fav back in the day when I was younger, and then I graduated to space mountain 😤 Did you ever go to Legoland? That place was also v lit

Very patriotic crush! I was a big iron man fan back in the day, since technology was his super power - he is basically peak evolution of the SF tech bro (also liked his sass)

Haha the emails go to me because he wouldn't let me forward them to him 😩 but ya drop a line - we are trying to make him a hinge! The ladies must feel intimidated by its crazy production value and ingenious craftsmanship obviously - if I ever make it rich I'm buying him a billboard on the highway 😛

Website looking fresh! You could've crushed it at the coding events 😤 Having a github is another sf rite of passage, so now you can proudly say you're one of the cool kids 😎 If you ever wanna keep honing your craft, making a personal website is a really good way to learn more!

We'll see, might drop in an app tonight!","2021-08-31 22:05:52",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","How did I not know this I feel like such a boomer 😅The more you know! Good pun 😮‍💨 If watching all the movies on repeat and playing the xbox games 24/7 doesnt do some damage idk what will- Star Wars basically raised me! Def a big fan, kinda a disappointment since disney took over tho 😩

Omg I can totally relate, binging tv shows is totally different! I recently saw A Quiet Place 2, and already can't wait for the next one! But I do have some TV shows on my list to complete. I'm watching 9 Perfect Strangers on Hulu rn, they release a new episode every week so no binging allowed :( it's really testing my patience - really taking me back to the good ol days when cable tv was a thing! I also want to see what Ted Lasso and The White Lotus is all about. Are there any shows on your radar? 

I had the same Disneyland ""maturing"" experience when It came to my fav rides! Honorable mention also go to Splash Moutain and Indiana Jones. I've never been to Legoland🤭 but was a big fan of Magic Mountain after I got over my fear of upside down roller coasters 😵‍💫

I do appreciate iron mans brains and sass. Def teared up watching end game 😪 

I'm basically a tech brah? (Girl version of bro?) I did create a website on wix awhile back in my concert days 🤩 

Let me know if you end up singing up as a volunteer! I'm going to be workin a lot in Sept and October! ◡̈ ","2021-09-01 01:39:58",,"http://63.55.163.215/servlets/mms?message-id=14F11BF38D7D00000E70000201"
"Me","","Haha ya learn something every day! Glad you liked the pun, I try to keep them subtle and not Force them too hard 😎 What's your fav of the pre Disney ones??

Are you big into horror kinda stuff? I am too chicken for that tbh 🐔 Honestly one episode a week is for the best, gives ya something to look forwards to :') What's the low down on 9 perfect strangers? Should I check it? I've been super out of the loop on tv shows lately 😩 but Netflix gave me an ad for a new witcher thing so I might check that soon!!

The Indiana Jones ride was lit!! I remember the boulder so fondly :') Also the matterhorn ride was a classic too! All these memories coming back

Ya Mr Stark I don't feel so good 😭 definitely hit v hard seeing him develop a soft side and then have his boi get snapped 💀

Haha I like tech brah! Wow so much work experience!! What was your business name??

I'll keep ya posted! Do you have any particular concerts, or will you just be working the scene??","2021-09-01 02:58:44",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","I haven't seen the older movies in years, I think it's time for another marathon 😱 do you have a fav? 

I do like a good thriller but usually only put on a scary movie if it's a special occasion or I'm in the mood, halloween is coming up 👻 waiting on weekly episodes does add some spice to my life - v wholesome :,) 

You should def add 9 Perfect Strangers to your list! It's so hard to describe but it won't disappoint! If it does- catch these hands 😤 

I'm watching a Deep Dive into Disney Adults video on YouTube as we speak, it's kinda hilarious ...Disney adults can't be trusted 😶

Were you a fan of the OG Spider-Man movies? My brother loved him when we were younger, v spider-stan energy 😜 

The website is basically an extension of the GitHub link I sent earlier! I want to spend more time on it 😊

I haven't gotten my schedule yet but I'll let you know! I hope I get some artist hospitality tasks🤞🏼 I'd die if I got to show Lizzo to her trailer or fetch Tyler the Creator some coffee 🥲","2021-09-01 03:54:36",,"http://69.78.32.166/servlets/mms?message-id=02F11DD5049F00003840000201"
"Me","","Ya I also haven't watched them in forever! I'll pick empire strikes back for the yoda training montage, v iconic

I'm a big fan of Halloween for the pun based costumes!! Also discount chocolate right after 🤤 What's your #1 holiday??

Haha I will add to the list - I'll keep the criticisms to myself 😉 can't be catching any hands  🤛😤🤜

I will add that to my queue to! What does the a l g o r i t h m usually recommend you? I've been spending too much time on YouTube tbh

Early Toby Maguire is very funny to watch now haha especially in Spider-Man 3! But ya I definitely liked them a lot! Gotta respect the spider-stan

O nice! Lemme know if you have web questions (speaking of, spider man would be a great web developer 😎)

Ya hospitality would be super lit! You could always get Lizzo her juice 😎 Are you high up in the volunteer food chain so you can get these primo jobs?","2021-09-01 13:05:49",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","The empire strikes back is legit! I do kinda miss the Anakin Skywalker days before he turned to the dark side😖

As I've gotten older Halloween has become more of a fav of mine- due to the punny costumes and candy (I have a biiiig sweet tooth) but it's up there w Christmas bc I just love that time of the year ☺️ I'm here for the jolly vibes. With your pun game I'm sure you've had a few good costumes! My fav was prob Scooby Do where some of my friends dressed up as the gang! Still have yet to go to crazy Halloween party tho 💀 

I mean I'm always here for a strong opinion- but don't be shocked if I hit ya w one back 😉

Rn it's filled w crash course videos and actors on actors interviews- w a dash of hot girl summer inspo vids #guilty 😇

Have you seen Into the Spider-Verse?! That movie is def on my top 10 🤩

I'll def come to you w all my web related questions if ya don't mind the ~chaotic energy~ that is my brain 🧠 

Lizzo doesn't need the juice, she already gots it 😎 haha - I'm on the ambiance crew so I'd be thrown into different tasks than the volunteers...I think! ","2021-09-01 17:05:50",,"http://69.78.32.182/servlets/mms?message-id=04F128E2CC1200000B60000201"
"Me","","Ya I'll give it to ya Hayden was a cutie before his legs and arms burned off

Which of the classic Halloween candies are vegan? Is chocolate off the table?? Scooby doo is a classic! Who were you?? My magnum opus is probably mike tie-son, I got his face tat and wore a lot of ties, very few drunk people understood it haha - also I think technically Sunday night at outside lands is on Halloween, so that can be your crazy Halloween party!

Here is my strong opinion: soup is the worst medium of food consumption 😤

Tell me more about hot girl summer inspo!

I did! It was p good, very wild multiverse

I'm a big fan of chaotic energy, it's the best type! Do you have any whacky ideas in your chaotic brain rn?

Haha you're right, I failed the hospitality test right there - ya ambiance crew sounds like you'd be setting the vibe 😎 sounds like a good place to be","2021-09-01 22:07:55",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","Hayden?! Is this a new character I should know about 😉

Dark chocolate is never off the table for me it's my weakness 😇Honestly I'm a bad vegan once Halloween hits, then in January I'm a born again vegan 😅 the holiday goodies are hard to resist! You'd be surprised to know that a lot of the fruity candies are vegan like skittles,
Jolly ranchers, and sour patch kids! 

I was the scooby doo- he was my fav when I was little so I had dibs! V cleaver w Mike Tie-son I would've appreciated that 👏 I know that's why I'm so excited for OL! It's the cherry on top 🎃 

Whaaaat you don't like soup?! You haven't had good soup then! Soup hits harrrrrd during the winter- I've discovered lots of vegan recipes 👀 

Hot girl summer is like a mindset to be your most ✨ evolved ✨ version of your self basically. But the trends are v green juice, healthy eats, going to the gym, face masks, yoga, self care etc- it's like a glow up mindset

I'm alllll abojt that controlled chaos 😛One thought I had on the plane was how engagement and wedding rings are basically just an extension of the idea that women are basically property. Like her maritial status is apart of her identity, like the world needs to know she's married. Why can't she just be the same women she was- why does she need to present herself as married to the world? Idk if that makes much sense. Big feminist energy- don't get me wrong I'm all about celebrating your love w the world juuuuust a thought ","2021-09-02 01:37:36",,"http://69.78.88.102/servlets/mms?message-id=05F13008F3E100009D20000201"
"Me","","Hayden is the actor of Anakin haha, he has lots of infamous lines in the prequels

Ya that's what January is for haha, everybody knows diets don't exist during the holidays - I am a big dark chocolate fan, always gotta have some nearby 😋 also ya that makes sense, no animal products in sugar 😉

Scoob is a classic! Did Blake think you were appropriating her culture? Did you speak in the accent too? That's very important 😤 also haha glad you like it - another time my friend dressed as a bull and I went as a matt-a-door (with a lil door around my neck that said ""hi my name is Matt"") - the puns are everything! Do you have an OL costume planned??

No no, substitute soup for a nice hot toddy and now we're talking 😋 

Oo I like the hot girl summer energy, it sounds like you have a v wholesome YouTube feed!

Counter argument is that guys get wedding rings too right? Maybe we are all suckers in the eyes of the Titans of Ring Industries, who have been feeding us expensive ring propaganda for centuries!! Time to fight the system and have newlyweds get matching face tats instead 😤","2021-09-02 03:21:52",,

Sounds like you are the king of Halloween w all of those costumes, how are you going to level up your costume game this year? I don't have a costume planned yet for OL so if you have any ideas lmk 🤩

what's a hot toddy 🤭 pls educate me 

I'm glad you support the hot girl summer vibe - just in time for hot girl fall!!! (I may or maybe not have a vision board goin already)

"Me","","Haha me and Hayden are bffs - jk I'm subscribed to a reddit page that goes crazy over the prequels (even though I haven't watched them in a literal decade) but they are big hayden stans 

Ya I am a sucker for the puns 😩 I don't have any ideas for this Halloween tho - usually I get pun inspiration from seeing stuff but covid has reduced the rate of punnable things I see 😭 but I did get to go into my company's temporary office today, so maybe more inspo will strike me! What's your Halloween costume muse typically?

Hot toddy is the best drink when it's cold outside! Basically hot water, whiskey, lemon, and honey! Bonus points for some whipped (vegan ofc) cream

Send vision board!! Are you a big Pinterest user?

Ya cheaper than a ring, and you can't lose then either 😉","2021-09-02 21:27:01",,

My muse is usually pintrist telling me what's good and then last minute throwing something together that I'm not super excited about. Hopefully this year I can follow through w a fun costume from start to finish 😎 

Omg I'll have to try and top it w some whipped cream - you know what's up w that vegan life 😛 I tried cooking Seitan for the first time tonight and it was a complete fail. Can only go up from here right?!

Office was chill, free lunch, boba, and dinner 🤤 and nice to see everybody, but they order the dinner late to peer pressure you into staying longer 😠 I kinda like my lazy morning routine working from home, but I might go in later in the day! 

I may or may not have found your Pinterest with a quick Google 👀 but I dig the aesthetic! Disappointed by lack of Halloween costume Pinterest board tho 😛

Oo seitan looks really interesting - it's like bread meat?? Did you make from scratch or did you cook from a package? Also ya, if you set the bar incredibly low, you can't be disappointed in the future, good tactical decision there haha

Omg no way I'm going to go stalk myself to see what you saw 😅 most of my boards are private 😏 v exclusive 

It was from a package, there's not much to work w out here bc my dads kitchen is a lil neglected lol

"Me","","Ya I think there was a lot of politics and stuff that definitely went over my young head, all I saw was lightsaber go brrrr

Free boba changes a man haha (there's free coffee too 😱) - also ya there's a saying ""there's no such thing as free lunch"" - if you think about it, if you balance price of food with the amount of extra work they get from you staying, it ends up working for the company I think

Lazy morning routine = wake up ten minutes before first meeting - then take the meeting in bed with camera off 😛 but sometimes I wake up two hours before and go for a nice lil bike ride! What about you?


Ooo what juicy private boards do you have?? 

Oh no rip the kitchen! I'm sure if you had an unneglected kitchen it'd be the best seitan there is 😤

Haha here ya go: https://www.pinterest.com/matthewkaufer we have very similar pinterest account naming conventions it seems 😉 ya I'm v happy with how apartment turned out!

Haven't heard there's no such thing as free lunch in forever, brings me back to econ class in hs! 

That morning routine sounds v similar to mine in college! I've been trying out a few diff routines but lately I'd wake up and make my coffee do some work for a few hours and then workout - after another 200mg of caffeine ofc 🥴 when I was really into parks and rec I'd put on an episode of that in the morn. Where do you like to ride in SF?! 

Not many of my private boards are juuuuuicy, I keep them private so they don't throw off my home feed - like recipes or other unappealing graphic design tutorials. My juiciest private board is prob my wedding inspo 😅 I can't help myself when I come across somethin toooo good to not save yenno? I also blame my BFF for getting married and inspiring me lol

What inspired a stretch class?! You seem to do a lot of hosting! do you have roommates that join these events?

You can stalk my long bike rides on my very dead strava! https://www.strava.com/athletes/88454487 I do a loop around the city, my fav part is near the water / el camino del mar!

That's p juicy! Are you a destination wedding kinda gal? Do you have a big theme in mind?? Ya how dare she, very selfish of her getting married like that 😛

We have a meeting called ""Stretch Goals"" because it sounds like a business planning word, and would blend into our calendars haha but we actually just stretch (or used to stretch, recently it's been lots of talking and crosswords tbh) - but then people found out about it, and we have a wellness challenge this month, so they invited the whole company, and I was chosen to lead 😩 My roommate actually works at my company too (we went to HS together) so he was stretching as well!

I used to commute to work on bike, and also bike to do errands / go climbing, but started doing longer bike rides when I was in mountain view during covid! 

Whoa camping wedding sounds in-tents ⛺ 🥁 haha - also I think the most important part of any wedding is the open bar 😉 But ya that sounds very nice! 

They were only there virtually through zoom! But when we had our housewarming, we squeezed like 40 ppl from the company in our lil place! Our schedules aren't that similar, but also we have our own bathrooms so it isn't a problem 😌 big fan of the 2b2ba lifestyle

Ooooo I expect nothing less than good puns from you 😜 - yes an open bar is v important and good music!!

Hit me w that stretching zoom link next time 😉 haha in all honestly I need to prioritize stretching more, im getting old 😭 Lucky you!! I used to share a room + bathroom w one of my friends in 2019 but now I have my own room and bathroom rn and it makes a biiiig difference 😶‍🌫️

B&Js come up w so many  good names and unique flavor combos! Also their activism is boss af 😎 the one I had last night was just called cold brew coffee w fudge - sadly nothing on your pun level!

I moved to mountain view when covid started for cheaper rent and more space, since I figured I wouldn't be able to go outside much / would rather be quarantined somewhere spacious - it was nice but I like the city a lot more! Why'd ya move out of SF to SLO?

Haha ya that's my go to camping pun, very high stakes ⛺ the funniest wedding music I've experienced was at my cousin's wedding, most of my family (specifically the older folks) are not big into rap, and this was right when the whip / nae nae became big, and they played that song after some billy joel or smthn, and all the old people looked so disgusted, it was very funny to see haha

Haha I'll keep you posted, hopefully I won't need to lead it next time (the people that would usually lead it were ooo so they called me in for backup 😤) but ya we do it like once a quarter! But ya that was like the first time I stretched for real in a quarter too 💀 I recently hurt my hand climbing so I'm gonna be big on the stretch grind when I get back into it

Woohoo solo bathroom living!! Sharing a room is tough! I feel like after that, you either become much better, or much worse friends (hoping it was the former!!)

Wow ya I feel like an un-punny name is very uncharacteristic of them 🤔 what's your fav flavor of theirs? I'm tied between half baked and phish food 🤤 Also please your pun game is pretty 🔥 too! Coming up with flavor names for b&j would be a good retirement job

After a few months I decided it was time to move back to SLO to finish up classes online and get the last bit of a college experience I could!

Ooo if you get hired at peloton I'd be v impressed. I don't think I could ever be a fitness instructor, idk how they manage to talk while exercising

Yes the chunkier the better!!! I also love a good gooey carmel moment 😋 you just can't be stopped w the camping puns idk if I can beat the heat 🥵 

Yes I gotta get back to ballin asap I've got lots of ankles to break 😤 

I've got lots of traveling today so hit me w any music and pod recs ◡̈

I think the only rap my dad will listen to is beastie boys, maybe you can use that as a gateway drug for your dad haha

Ya same here, but I think I could talk if I lead a stretch class 😉 

How often do you usually ball? Ankle breaking is incredibly important 😤

Oo I never got too big into podcasts 😩 but there's one you might like called song exploder! They break down songs and have the artists explain the behind the scenes decisions that made the song! I feel like I haven't discovered too much new music lately, but I'll bump my discover weekly and see what comes up! What's your current go to travel playlist?","2021-09-05 20:34:01",,

"Caitlin","2132487674","Right! He even put up some curtains to separate the living room v nyc vibes 🥲 tbh my bear doesn't have a name. I remember thinking when I was little that there wasn't a perfect name for him so he's nameless - if that makes sense 😅 

I recently took a yoga class and forgot how hard it was to hold certain poses 🥵 I want to try to work more yoga into my morning routine for those hella fall cozy vibes 

Not often enough at all! I've played a lot this week tho vb, basketball, then baseball -oh my! When I'm w my family it's all we do haha I realized how much I missed playing all of them 😢

Ooo yes I love song exploder! Have you seen their series on Netflix 🤩 

My go to playlist for flying is actually an album, Junk of the Heart by The Kooks! I downloaded it back in 2015 and listen to it on the plane - it's like a traveling tradition 😌 

Maybe I should listen to my phone more then?! ","2021-09-06 00:30:57",,"http://63.55.224.23/servlets/mms?message-id=22F17F92081000002DA0000201"

"Me","","Ya makes sense! If you're in the market for a name, you always have Bearnard! My company gave me a big whale plushie, it is also nameless rn but it could def use a name too! Maybe whallace 🤔

Ya all I know is child pose, but it's a pretty good pose imo 🙇 also back in the day we did the ""starfish stretch"" which is just laying on your back haha ⭐ When I did a yoga class for the first time it was so tough, I wasn't a believer in yoga as real exercise until that fateful day! 

Sports with the fam sounds so wholesome - are you the #1 athlete in the family?? Jk rhetorical question, ofc you are 😤

I haven't seen their Netflix show but I'll check it out! Need something to watch in between 9 perfect strangers 😉

O I used to listen to a lot of kooks! I know the title song off the album but idt I know any others from that album - that's a v wholesome travel tradition tho! I usually just go through discover weekly while trying to find a comfortable way to nap on the plane

Ya ya listen to your phone, it is very wise 😛 

Also yes I am a bad steward of our playlist 😭 I've been listening to it a lot but not contributing 😩 I'll try to add some songs by end of week (also please roast me if I do not!!) What's your usual process for discovering new tunes??","2021-09-06 02:52:05",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","If you name your whale, Whallace  or Whalter 🐳 I'll name my Bear, Bear-nard🧸 -these emojis are cute af I had to throw them in there 

Child pose is simple but life changing - yoga in a nutshell tho. 
I thought the same thing! in fact I despised yoga bc my step mom was really into it when I was younger so naturally I hated on it haha she is the epitome of Meredith from Parent Trap 😒

I mean I'd like to think I'm the mvp of the maltbie fam but my brother and I make eachother work for it - he's got all the height and being tiny has never really worked in my favor 😫 thx for the hype tho 🥲

Don't forget about The Chair!! There's only 1 season rn and it's a chill watch 😎 yesss what ep of 9PS are u on?! New ep this Wednesday! 

My discover weekly has been sooo 🔥 lately, thats how I've been finding new jams - in addition to your recs + stuff u add to the playlist ofc 😉 no pressure w the playlist!

Haha that's a hilarious way to learn to hate yoga, gotta go against the step mom's likes 😤  were there any other hobbies you learned to hate thanks to her?

Staying competitive against your brother despite height disadvantage makes you all the more impressive!! And ofc hype is very important 😤

I won't forget about the chair! I may or may not have binged all the available 9ps episodes the last two nights 👀 But ya very excited for Wednesday!! I think Hulu supports watching shows in sync with other ppl, if you wanna do a watch party!

My discover weekly has been a hot mess, too many different genres of stuff I listen to leads to a very chaotic soundscape! But I'm glad the spotify gods have been in your favor! I would never abandon our playlist 🙅 but if you have ideas for other seasonal playlists I'm down to start a new one! Also saying summer is coming to an end is v sad to hear 😭","2021-09-06 18:59:35",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","Real adults not only have stuffed animals but also make them and aren't ashamed to show it!!! I love this journey for us 

I also had a hatred for tennis bc it's the only sport she played/cared about so it was always on in the house - when I'd rather watch literally anything else lol. Also, my dad took her to the Dodgers World Series game (I had a concert so I didn't go) but I was still salty about it bc she doesn't even watch the game when we go 🙄 

I make up for my height w scrappiness 😈 and sometimes that leads to a sprained ankle -there's really no other option 🤕

Ahhhh 😍 so what are your thoughts/ who are your fav characters? I'm so glad you like it! Yes we should do a watch party! I'm free Wednesday or Thursday ◡̈ 

That's kinda a good thing that your discover weekly is chaotic bc then you get exposed to a wider array of music! I'm sure it not blending well can be overwhelming tho 😳 

Another playlist? I thought you'd never ask 🙈 I'm sorry I had to be the one to break the news, but at least we don't have to go back to school! Lol!! ","2021-09-06 23:10:15",,"http://69.78.88.102/servlets/mms?message-id=05F1928F3AE10000BB20000201"

Oh the yoga tennis combo, a big classic combo of bougie - also ya that's a big shame, what a waste of tickets 😩

Gotta respect the scrappiness 😤

Ya I am hooked! I originally thought the twist was gonna be that they drew blood so that they could literally kill the residents and bring them back to life like masha experienced, but I was a lil wrong (unless that's the end of season plot twist with the new protocol 🤔🤔🤔) - I really like Napoleon with his wholesome dad energy, and also I like smiley for his mildly chaotic energy but with a sweet spot 😀 What about you who's your fav? Also ya I'm down for Wednesday!!

Ya ya that is fair, I've definitely listened to lots of cool stuff because of it! Honestly thank goodness for spotify, the old days of itunes was so rough (and expensive, paying $1.29 for a song 💀)

Haha honestly I miss school 😩 such a simpler time, living in same building with friends, waking up at noon, all good things 😭 but ya what kinda vibe are ya feeling? We could do something that's like ""cozied up by fireplace with hot chocolate"" theme, that's the only thing that comes to mind when I think fall theme, but down for whatever!","2021-09-07 02:53:02",,

Sprinkle in some qvc home shopping network, manicures, and a late night cappuccino and you've got the bougiest of them all 👸

Originally I thought they were going to try to clone them or something but after seeing more of Masha's backstory I thought the exact same thing as you! I do like the happy go lucky dad energy from  Napoleon. I'm v interested in Francis back story bc if an author writes in an author as a character - I'm sure there's more to it then we think 🧐 this show is one big mystery I love it! 

The acting is 🙌🏼 did you know Melissa McCarthy's husband irl is always in her films?! In 9PS he's the guy from Canada who lied to her about his son and took her $ 🤧 what a guy #goals 

Yay can't wait for Wednesday ☺️

iTunes was really playing allllll of us. It's soooo crazy to think of how much music we get from a subscription based model. I hope we never go back to the old days - I do miss the simplicity of an iPod nano tho 🥲 the feedback you'd get from toggling between songs on the circular pad, v satisfying

I got this app called Spotistats! If you don't want to wait until Wrapped comes out to check your Spotify analytics - like me - you should download it 😎

Yeah I miss being in class tbh, being a transfer student from a cc into zoom university, I've spent a sad amount of time taking the majority of my classes online 💀 

We need to workshop a good fall/winter pun for our playlist! Cozy vibes w some cinnamon to spice it up 😜- bc I can't be wanting to crawl into bed n get cozy every time it comes on or else I'll have an unproductive winter 🥶 I think our summer playlist kinda found it's vibe after we started adding to it!

"Me","","Oh no not qvc shopping 😱 that is a very dark place, on the same plane as antique roadshow 💀

Oh ya cloning is a good guess too! We will find out soon enough, so much tension and intrigue!! What time should we watch tomorrow? My work has been a lil hectic today / I think it'll only get more hectic this week, but down for 9ish if that works for you?

Oooh yeah I could totally see the authors playing favorites haha that is a good call, we'll have to watch out for that 👀

I didn't know! But that's a primo fun fact! I liked the dream she had where he broke it off with her because her writing was trash 💀 where'd you get these juicy inside scoops from??

Ya apple had nice haptic feedback, rip to the end of an era 😭 but it's ok, a worthwhile trade for discover weekly and spotify stats ;) I'll def check out the app! I did some spotify stats of my own back in the day!! I pulled thousands of playlists and analyzed how Kanye songs were distributed among them to redefine his albums based on how people listen to his music!! Lots of cool data stuff to do with spotify

Transfer to zoom university is such a big oof, rip your college experience 😭

Waiiiiit whaaaat! I'm obsessed w infographs so if you have any of those or summaries of your findings I'd love to learn more! What inspired you to do this deep dive on Kanye?

Haha yes excellent I am ready for the play by play! Basically a real life Amazon xray 😤

Haha I had a big Kanye phase, and I feel like his albums all sound pretty unique / have distinct sounds, so I thought it'd be fun to analyze how people listen to them! I wrote all this up a while back, it's full of nerd speak but there are pretty graphs at some point! http://blog.kaufer.org/data-analytics/2018/12/26/spotfidfy.html

:,) has a v different energy than 🥲 I commend u for your loyalty!

Degeneracy followed w Dungeons and Dragons is a whole lotta D 👀🤪 lol I've never played that game before- what's the hype? 

I'm going to a dodger game today and staying in Santa Monica tonight, then a concert on Sunday 😍 v happy rn ","2021-09-10 17:59:12",,"http://63.55.66.39/servlets/mms?message-id=11F1DEAE2D180000E750000201"
"Me","","I think my phone has shazam built in 😎 the future is truly now!

I haven't seen the Billie film (glad you are on first name basis with her tho!) but ya I def like seeing artists tell us abt their lives / things that impact their tunes! Do you have any fav artist films?? Also good KM recommendations, v ez listening!

Haha thank you thank you, it's not ez typing those two extra characters :')

Haha lots of Ds indeed, maybe will need to finish with donuts on Sunday to complete the trifecta 😤 d&d is interesting, it's basically telling a big, semi-structured story with your friends, lots of shenanigans always ensue, also good way to stay in touch!

Wow ya that sounds lit! Who's playing Sunday? Also are the Dodgers doing good or bad this season?","2021-09-10 21:42:02",,

Ya ya Billie and I go waaaay back 💀 idk what my fav bio pics are buuuuut recently I've seen an episode on Dominic Fike who was one of my new favs of 2020! Wbu? Any good docs come to mind? 

Kacy (also on a first name basis w her 😉) is a dreamy cali beach sunset 🤤 her music really chills me out I love it! 

Donuts, dumplings, dip n dots - you pick! It's treat yo self Sunday 🥳 D&D sound so wholesome 

I'm seeing a long over due John Pardi concert, was rescheduled 3 times 😳 

The Dodgers were doing so good this season - until recently they've suffered some devastating losses and are now 2 game behind the Giants 🥴 buuuut they got that W Tonight! I think I'm their good luck charm 😎","2021-09-11 02:35:20",,"http://63.55.1.103/servlets/mms?message-id=10F1E5E3EC5200004260000201"
"Me","","Ya had to overcome adversity with my green message bar 😤

I think the last biopic I saw was the freddie mercury movie on a plane a while back, but I also saw the Johnny cash biopic (also on a plane) and it was p good, showed a much more flawed side than I knew from his music

Ya that's a good vibe! I've recently started listening to this big playlist of surf rock (like dick dale energy) for my chill beach vibes, they hit the spot too! I'm glad your work at concerts has landed you the honor of first name privileges 😉 I'm sure they're texting about you right now as well 😎

Big fan of treat yo self Sunday! I am a big sucker for dumplings too (as they say, good things come in small packages), maybe I will have to splurge 😤 Very important question - FMK: dippin dots, donuts, dumplings???

Are you gonna wear cowboy boots and camo? I hear bouncers are very strict about that dress code at country concerts!

Woohoo good luck charm! You just gotta go to all their games and they'll turn it around ez pz (or you can always jump ship to the Giants 😉)","2021-09-11 07:35:48",,

Was it bohemian rhapsody? That movie rocked my world 🤩 it inspired me to start a career in film/production asap and almost made me change my major in college 👀 I was shookith 

I love the beach rock vibes, I also have a playlist for that 🤗 ya ya we are all like this 🤞🏼 but I don't like to brag 😉 

As a smoll girl myself, I am a true believer that good things do come in small packages! I love me a FMK question: fuck donuts, marry dumplings, and kill da dip n dots! Wbu? 

I may just have to bust out my cowgirl boots to channel my inner Kacey Musgraves 🤠 I don't want the hate bc I used to wear red cowgirl boots to school everyday in 2nd grade! V cool

Ya it was! One day once you make all those business deals at those fancy hotels you work from, you can retire and pivot to film ez pz! What stopped you from switching majors??

Oo what's your beach playlist?? And yes say hi to Kacey for me 😛

Definitely kill dipndots (they're good but just not same level yaknow), donuts/dumplings is tough but I'd say marry dumplings too and fuck donuts

Ya you gotta get the cowboy boots! You must've been the coolest kid in all of second grade 😉 if only you had the boots and rolly backpack at the same time, you would've been unstoppable","2021-09-11 17:45:13",,

I can see it so clearly now 🥺 thanks for painting that pic - have you considered creative writing?!? V descriptive! I was about to transfer for business and didn't want to start over w the pre reqs for film, plus it seemed a lil risky🤨

The title is soooo original, don't steal it 😝 https://open.spotify.com/playlist/50KC8RX4JwTq0rWyePWcXS?si=UZiok0NxSN-MUmFkWzdVCQ&dl_branch=1

I had the same conversation w myself regarding who yo FMK. Dumplings just seem like they'd been more dependable and hardworking and donuts seemed like a good time tho 😋 lol 

FMK - boba, TJs mini cones, and our summer playlist 

I def chose style over comfort those days and liked to stand out 😉 buuuut I grew out of all of that and am kinda the opposite now 🙃 The boots will be making their debut tomorrow tho - the worlds not ready ","2021-09-11 22:04:35",,"http://63.55.224.23/servlets/mms?message-id=22F1F639946A0000BE10000201"
"Me","","Haha no I always hated writing in school, def stuck to the computers instead 🤓

Oh true those are good reasons, ya I think breaking into music or film would be super risky, too extreme for me

Haha you could be a creative writer yourself with that 🔥 playlist title, I don't think it can be topped 

Ya I'm a big donut fan (ate some 🔥 mini ones today) but I think I would get tired of donuts before dumplings!

You are asking a hard hitting question uh oh - ok I gotta marry the playlist obv (even though it might look like I'd kill it bc I haven't added a song recently 💀), boba beats mini cones, but just barely,  so F on boba K on cones - I had to really introspect for this one tho - what's yours?

Ya comfort or bust! Have you finally freed yourself from the shackles of women's pocketless pants? Also ya get those cowboy boots out 😤 Have you been practicing your yeehaw? 🤠","2021-09-12 02:35:46",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","Well that paid off right?!? Leave the ""creative"" titles to me, I gotcha 😎

A lil risk never hurt no one! But I'm right there w you- id rather wait until a lil later to everything for the dream 🤩

Humble me why don't you! I've been work shoppin that one for awhile, im glad you approve 😉 

Even tho I have THE biggest sweet tooth- I would've  totally given up donuts for dumplings! I do need an OG SF experience tho! 

Idk def marry the playlist too- I've been adding so much too it! I hope you don't mind that I hijacked it! Tbh I might continue to add songs to it bc it's been my go to gym #pump playlist lately! It's the only thing that gets me goin 😤 esp everytime I hear a song you added! 

Sadly id have to K the mini cones bc ive never had them! And F boba! 

I have freed myself from the pocketless pants BUT I am a hoe for rompers or dresses w pockets! It's truely a special day when I score a fit like that 

These boots were made for walkin- and that's just what I DID 😜🤠 today was so much fun! I miss concerts so much ","2021-09-13 01:28:07",,"http://63.55.99.247/servlets/mms?message-id=1FF20D2F52190000DDB0000201"
"Me","","Ty glad we can leverage all your marketing knowhow!

Ya by the time I'll have $$ to do risky things, I'll probably be too old to want to do risky things 😭, it's a big struggle

No humbling allowed 😤, beach rock is clearly your playlist title magnum opus, even beating out picnic at the disco (but just barely ofc)

Ya ofc when you're in town we can go on a dumpling excursion! I'm on a quest for the best dumpling spot! I've heard Bob's bakery does good donuts too, but I've never been able to catch them while they're open 😩

I encourage the hijacking! But I promise I will add to it one of these days 👀 Also that is a very tasteful way of guilting me into adding more songs 😉

Oh that's a big travesty, but ya I guess the mini cones are not vegan friendly 😩 maybe one day TJs will realize the big market they're missing there 🙏

Oh wow dresses with pants sound v rare, that's a big score for sure 😤 Rompers are also v cute but I'll never understand the bathroom logistics behind them! They should make rompers with a zipper belt so they can just turn into shirt/pants at will 🧠

I'm glad you had a hoot! Is the country music concert vibe much different from the alt rock concert vibe??","2021-09-13 11:56:16",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","We are pretty much the dream team, computers + marketing make the world go round! 

You could be a cool grandpa and full send it w the risky business 😜

I know how much of a fan you are of picnic at the disco 🕺🏻I'm shocked to hear that beach rock  is the one that caught your attention 😉 I had to dig deep to access the genius that is beach rock 😎 hopefully I can do it again for ya 

Yesss I'm looking forward to our dumpling + donut adventure ☺️ what's your fav donut?! 

Guilting? Who? Me? Nooo 😉 I do look forward to the day you hijack the playlist for yourself! Sharing is caring Matt!!! 

I keep seeing the mini cones online - IG can either read my mind or is reading our messages 👀 I think I need to see what these cones are all about for myself! good thing I'm a free-gan (vegan unless it's free) aka a cool vegan 😎 

I didn't think guys even noticed the romper struggle! ⭐️ for you!! They are v cute and safer than dresses IMO but are def a struggle when it comes to the bathroom logistics - basically have to strip down completely haha your design could save lives! Lmk if you bring it to market, I'll be your first early adopter 😇

Country concerts are v different from alt concerts! I feel like that goes for all genres tho - and even different artists too. Each show is p unique! But maybe that's my OCD brain talking (obsessive concert disorder) 🤩

Haha yes I'm sure there are more genius playlist names coming soon, very excited for them!! Should we kick off the fall one??

I'm a sucker for a double chocolate donut! I went to a place called hookt this weekend with p tasty mini donuts, would recommend!! Idt anything will be as good as the SLO place you plugged tho 😭

Haha you are a very good guilter - it's hard to discover new songs when I'm always listening to our 10/10 hits tho 😉 but today marks a new discover weekly so I'll see what's in store

Honestly would not be surprised, zuck probably wants to learn about our great taste in music for the algorithm 😛 Ya bless the freegan lifestyle, I will donate a cone to you so you can eat it with a clear conscience 😉

Thank you for the ⭐🙇 ya look out for rompers v2 coming to a store near you, will definitely let you beta test haha - I used to sew a lot of chalk bags for climbing, but idt I could do clothes 😭

Haha OCD is a good acronym - speaking of concerts, I got a ticket for outside lands on sat!!! But also very sad I didn't get one for Friday, but my friend kinda rush bought them, but ya v excited for vampire weekend and also this guy named marc rebillet who does live mixed improv funk soul kinda stuff!

I'm only a good guilter bc you're a good guiltee (??? Not the best speller 🙈) ya our summer playlist can be a lil distracting - but we can't help curating the perfect blend of bangers and anti bangers bc you know all about the anti bangers right 😜 discover weekly really puts the team on its back, no pressure 👀 

I am truly blessed to have someone like you who understands the freegan lifestyle! How'd I get so lucky 😉

He can sew?!?! Go off!!! What are the chalk bags for?! 

Outside Lands!!! Yay I'm so happy for you! I know how hard it can be to get your hands on tickets 🥳 Hopefully I'm working artist hospitality and can get you close enough to meet Mr. Vampire Weekend himself 😏 I checked out yo boi Marc and really enjoyed Vaccinated Attitude- I sensed some lil dicky energy in his lyrics he's talented af- I would know bc I dabbled w the improve back in my days as Drama president back in middle school 😜 Ive got my eye out for Lizzo and Remi Wolf on sat myself.

I think guiltee belongs in the dictionary if you ask me! Tbt when we actually had antibangers in the playlist 😩 now the playlist is listenable again! Also idk if this weeks discover weekly fits the vibe too well but I'll give it another listen 👂

Ya I'm pretty awesome 💁 jk I'm even more blessed to have somebody with such a good ear for music and keen taste in hulu shows 😉

Chalk bags are for climbing! I think my crowning achievement was a kirby themed bag I made a while back!

Wow meeting count dracula himself would be pretty wild!! Also I feel like Marc's spotify isn't the best but his YouTube is pretty 🔥

I didn't know I've been talking to the drama president herself!! What kinda improv did ya do / are you still into it?? Now the genius playlist names make more sense 😉

I think I only know one lizzo song, but I'll check her and remi and huron out more! Maybe they'll give me some playlist inspiration too 😩

My discover weekly so far has been - meh. gonna have to really put in the effort in the search myself... Spotify spoiled me 😔

Staaaap you're too kind! Well I don't think ive ever gotten compliments on 2 of the human senses before, in 1 sentence 😚 just sight, smell, and touch left to go 😜

Ok ok the Kirby theme is v cute - you'd make a killing on Etsy! Lmk if you need help w a pricing and marketing strategy 🙏🏼

Yeah I don't usually tell people about my secret status this early on bc they always treat me dif!! buuuuut I thought u could handle it 😜 haha - I took a few classes when I was younger in LA (another one of my dads attempt to sell my soul to every activity he could find) but we mainly worked on whatever play or musical was goin on at the time!

That's a pretty good music video, but am very disappointed the fab 5 didn't drop any bars 😭 I feel like Jonathan could go hard

Ya I listened to some remi yesterday at work! I really liked photo id and disco man (there were a bunch of others I liked too but I forgot the names!) - and of course, your emoji charades is on point!! 👌🙆🐢

Ya the musical aesthetic is always great to see, and cruella (from what I know from the og 101 dalmatians) has that in spades! Although I never could've imagined Emma Stone playing a villain! A 10/10 from mz.prez is quite the accolade, who needs imdb when the world has you 😉

Woohoo enjoy Arizona! Any fun plans? And ya watching 9ps with you is a big highlight of my week too 😘 it's fun to dish as stuff happens

Work smarter not harder 😉 I'm going to work on the cover rn so you can start adding ASAP!!! 

I'll take an 89% any day of the week! either way the playlist was collaborative so we both had something to do w that score!

Do you know the broke/woke meme? Crossed (drunk and high at same time) is kind of a synonym for blend, but we can have fun with just a wholesome ol spotify playlist (the more I explain it the more understandable it is to me that you didn't get it haha)

Can't wait for your artistry 😉

Ya that's a strong B+!! Also so much shade 😩 to think I could've made it 100% if only I added my songs 💀 Also who's to say Olivia wasn't your addition 👀 brutal goes pretty hard, but i think good for you is the biggest banger! Are you SOUR that it got added 😉","2021-09-17 00:39:02",,

Excellent name change! Also can we talk about your album art??? It looks so good, 10/10 production value! What'd you make it with?

Ya I'm a big fan of giving/receiving shade, dw 😈 I was looking at the blend on desktop and it didn't say who added what, but now on mobile I see it all 👀 I listen to a v weird collection of songs depending on the vibe of the day, which will lead to some chaotic blend pics 😉 but ya this one Olivia song in the playlist will convert you, by next week, I'll see a sea of purple songs in the blend, all tracing back to you 😎","2021-09-17 08:10:01",,

Yes we are all tea sipping Kermit sometimes haha - you will be converted to a rodrigo listener soon enough!

This playlist makes me want to cook some penne marinara and walk the line w some fine red wine 🍷 

Someone who puts in the real work for a playlist and isn't afraid to admit it! You can't rush perfection 😉 I will pace myself w the additions to give you a chance to catch up next week, pinky promise ","2021-09-18 02:18:26",,"http://63.55.128.119/servlets/mms?message-id=13F272786B710000E920000201"

Ya that playlist makes me wanna put a mouse on my head and act like a human puppet, amirite? 

No need to pace yourself, I'll be able to handle it 😤 also I gave my tech talk abt how to make your own bootleg spotify blend yesterday, so if all goes well, these MIT kids will make me an algorithm to add to the playlist for me 😤 (jk I would never jeopardize the artistic integrity of our playlists)","2021-09-18 09:10:23",,

Droppin that knowledge on those MIT peeps, you're inspiring a new generation 😎 Is this the same project as the blog post you wrote about Kanye's albums? I wonder how his new album would effect that 🧐 ty ty for not leaving our precious playlists in the hands of a stranger 🥲 

I can't believe I was the first to send you fan mail about your blog #loyalfan I do have a suggestion tho! you should have your hyperlinks open in a new tab to make it easier for readers to go back to your blog!

Ya similar spotify math stuff! With a sprinkle of corporate sponsorship, since they paid for my trip 😉 Ya I didn't wanna redo the Kanye analytics with the Jesus tunes, might get a lil chaotic / mess with my results! Also ofc ofc, you get nothing but the best certified, organic, free range, gluten free playlist picks 😉 farm to table song recommendations!

Thank you for being a ride or die fan - I'll need to think of the phrase to refer to my matt blog fans as - you can be the matt-riarch? Diplo-matt? Your matt-jesty? 

I will share a special tech bro tip with you (since I hate opening links only to have them redirect me in same tab too!) - if you cmd-click the link (or ctrl on windows) it opens it in a new tab!! Ty for the feedback tho ❤ I will try to incorporate it one of these days!","2021-09-19 12:00:15",,

Those are some high standards for the playlist pickings 🧺 but are they certified vegan, grass fed, and Non-GMO playlist pics? 😉

Ride or die, thru thick n thin, always and 4 Evr!!! Call me a diplo-Matt, fan accounts coming soon 😜

Haha no I just had to brainstorm to give the young'uns some inspiration for things to build! Also you're right, I gotta revive the Insta, get some yoga pants, really lean into it! No vlogs, but they uploaded my tech talk and it got more views than the other tech talks 💁 so basically a vlogger 😤 You could also rock the insta influencer lifestyle (or you could be a manager for Blake's??? Sponsored by big pet food??)

Ofc they are vegan picks, gotta cater to my audience 😉

You should consider joining the matt fan club, membership includes free pumpkin ice cream mini cones!

Ofc I started with mac for you 😉 just an educated guess haha","2021-09-19 20:26:26",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","No special treatment here 👀 you have to wait to see the final result like everyone else 😉 I won't stop you from stalking my Spotify tho - thats my love language haha 😛 

Better than a vlogger! Of course your vid performed the best bc no one else delivers the info AND the jokes like you do😜 but I think I need to see this for myself - drop the link!!! 🤩

The more connected you are w your audience the better reviews they will leave 😉

Ummmmm im sold, but what do the super fans get?! - I had some choc chip cookie dough ice cream from B&J tonight 😋 your PSL boba inspired me (was it Boston boba?!) ","2021-09-20 04:10:46",,"http://69.78.32.182/servlets/mms?message-id=04F299FC15A10000B650000201"
"Me","","The next program I write should be a way of automatically checking when you update your playlist pics 😉 Also hopefully today will be the day I have time to add songs to the playlists 👀 (altho I did add one over the weekend 😤😤😤) - also stay tuned for the Hulu flowchart, also coming soon!

I will only share link if you reciprocate with a Caitlin YouTube link - ideally an embarrassing school project, those are my fav 😛 https://youtu.be/r_fufsU2Jqo but the slides stopped updating to the livestream half way through 😩 

Ofc I gotta get that 5 star customer satisfaction rating! I hear making playlists with customers is good for business - I will share that secret with my bosses too, hopefully drive up our Q4 revenue 😛

Ooo yes how could I forget about the super fans! Their perks include
* Up to 1 spotify song added to collaborative playlists per month 💀 (but the team at Matt HQ is working on ramping this perk)
* Free Mini Desk Concert attendance, not to be confused with NPR's Tiny Desk Concerts (the Matt HQ legal team is very diligent)
* Complimentary guitar lessons & auditions for mini desk concert membership
* Unlimited supply of puns (quality may vary)

Tell me more about Caitlin fan club benefits? I would consider myself a proud member 😉

That sounds so good right now, I want ice cream for lunch 😩 ya it was bahhhston bohhbahh - have you been to Boston? V neat city! Glad it was not snowing when I was there 😛","2021-09-20 14:28:25",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","That is music to my ears 😉 I did see that you added Vista Kicks and Bad Suns to the playlist 😍 I have meet them both, they’re great :,) def worth the anticipated additions! you know how to keep your diplomat-Matt’s happy 😉 oh don’t worry I won’t let you forget about the hulu flowchart! 

Caitlin’s super fan will have the following perks (and not limited to) 
*1 on 1 spotify consulting sessions 
*honest feedback and reviews on submissions (albums, singles, playlists, etc) 
*watch party's for streaming services (music biopics or docs heavily encouraged)
*live hotline for time sensitive life or death music emergency’s (or general life advice) 
*personalized top 10 tracks of the week newsletter (better than any algorithm ;) )
*exclusive industry alerts on the up-and coming artists and Bay Area concerts 
*will passionately entertain any convo that the super fan wants to engage in no matter how nerdy or basic 😉 
If you find a cooler name for my fans lmk, idk how to compete w the diplo-matts 

Idk what you rocked more - the presentation or that tech bro flannel 😉 but I’m v impressed w your work + you have a nice speaking voice! You can communicate and present your ideas w personality too! It’s like I was there 😜 did you write the description for the video? 

My scattered thoughts that you didn’t ask for but im going to share anyway 🧐: that Q from YouTube was v high school “how will this apply in the real world😈?!” Haha also I do agree that the Spotify blend isn’t that intelligent, maybe they need your help 😉 I’m a big fan of the Spotify user matching 👀 ok ok I heard you work on sell driving cars but I wanna know what you think about the ugliness and health hazards of LiDAR 🤨
p.s constructive criticism: your slides could use some ~spice~  

Sadly none of my best work blessed YouTube, since most of my efforts were behind the camera…but there may or may not be a copy of 7th grade Caitlin in Annie on dvd that I would(not) share if I could!!! 💀🤷🏼‍♀️ but I will dm you a cute vid of puppy blake from my IG that should suffices 

Bahhhston Bohhhbah > Bai Area Boba? No I’ve never been to Boston but I’m dying to visit the east coast again! I’d be down for a lil winter wonderland moment 🥺

Haha I try my best, it's the least I can do for my fans 🙇 and yes I gotta rush on that flow chart, due date is this Wednesday 😱

Wow I think the perks for the caitl-influencers/cait-listeners are even better than the diplomatts'! These bold claims of yours have the spotify engineers quaking in their allbirds! 

Ya I couldn't give the tech talk without my trusty tech flannel! Thank you for the kind words ❤ also can't believe you watched the whole thing! I think my co-worker came up with the description, you can tell it's not mine based on the lack of emoji 😉

I am a big fan of your thoughts! Also ya haha people that ask the intentional ""gotchas"" are truly built different 🤡 ya we should just launch a spotify competitor tbh, ez pz 😤

Also I didn't know lidar has safety risks, fill me in! I don't think the sensors are that ugly 🥺 the waymo cars look fresh! 

Ya I should've added some pizzazz 🤌 - not enough emoji tbh 😩

It sounds like the world needs to see this production of Annie! Maybe if I'm lucky... 🎶 the vid will come out - tomorrow! 🎶 Who'd ya play as?

Puppy Blake is so wholesome!!! Also 10/10 tunes/production quality on the vid! How old was Blake, she looked so smol!

Tbh I do not have a very discerning boba palette (I don't think I've had bad boba in my life 👀) but my colleagues are big into it and said it was p good! Where in the east coast were you most recently?? It is pretty neat to have seasons every once in a while haha

Dawww that's so wholesome! Big fan of the happy tail super-wagging 😍","2021-09-21 02:05:11",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","Back in my OCD (obsessive concert disorder) days when I would travel to LA a few times a month for like 2 years - I met Vista Kicks after a show they opened up for MGMT! And after seeing Bad Suns 5 times or so - I ran into them at a Phoenix concert in LA as well, I also happened to be wearing their merch like a tru fan 😇 still waiting for that follow back on spotify tho 

You are so good w these names, I'm stealing Cait-listeners 🤩 def using that for my portfolio - don't worry I'll give you credit! 

What can I say your presentation was v matt-ivating 😉 ahhh yes I should've known the lack of cute emojis was a dead give away

I've seen the Waymo cars driving around SF and my hot take is - they be lookin a bit ridiculous covered in spinning things and cameras of sorts. I don't think I could drive one myself bc it brings so much attention - I like to fly under the lidar 😜 haha maybe those parts are just for testing and wouldn't be on the final product? I've heard that the amount of sensors can be dangerous and cancer causing 😳 

You can 🎶 bet your bottom dollar 🎶 that the dvd won't be released to the world! It's v exclusive stuff!! Maybe a special viewing for the Cait-listeners 😉 I played Mollie, better known as the ""smallest"" orphan, I was most def type-casted 😭

Ty 😌 I had a lot of fun putting the video together! It was from 2017 so Blake was pushing 3 months 🥲 i was basically a teen mom then - thank goodness my voice has matured a bit😮‍💨

You're just boba inclusive - v woke 😉 tbh I don't think I have a discerning anything palette, I'm not a tough food critic, just happen to be here!

Haha glad you like it! And of course, gotta remember to cite your sources 😉

Ooh the counter puns, I've never heard that one before! Your pun game is im-matt-culate 😉

It may look ridiculous but it's the only way I think! Or they can have some big hockey puck looking things! Haha fly under the lidar is pretty good - I think the idea is you wouldn't own one, you just use it as a taxi! My friend works at a self driving company and he gave me a ride in one, it was v cool! I've never heard about cancer through lidar - I think lidar just shoots out beams of light but maybe there's something in the frequencies? 

Wow having to survive without that video is quite the 🎶 hard knock life 🎶 haha - yes I would be honored to join the special viewing 😍 Ya that type casting sounds pretty rude 😠 I'm sure you made up for their small typecasting with a huge voice (but I guess I'll never know 😭)

Ya Blake could've played Molly she was to teensy 😛 do you miss puppy Blake, or are you more into quarter-life-crisis Blake?

Thank you, some people are lactose intolerant, I'm just boba tolerant 😛 is the SLO mono-season just constant heat?","2021-09-21 22:18:47",,

You seem to know a lot of the Annie score, sounds like you’d be able to sing along w the dvd, if you’re lucky 😉 

Puppy Blake really tested my limits bc she would keep me up all night and cause some trouble - but I couldn’t help but love her despite her terrible twos phase 🥰 I am excited for her mid-life crisis tho bc we are trying to find her a baby daddy😍

Ooh the DJ situation is very important! Spotify discover weekly is basically self driving for music curation 🤔

Haha yes if I sang along, it would definitely be more embarrassing than young Caitlin/Molly - I wouldn't wanna steal the spotlight from you 😉

Yeah tbh I don't think I'm a fan of that ending! And I don't see where they would take it w S2! ","2021-09-23 02:48:43",,"http://63.55.128.103/servlets/mms?message-id=07F2D779E9F90000F630000201"
"Me","","That's super deep! I feel like I don't have that level of introspection tbh (all I know is masha wear black vs masha wear white 😛)

I thought the ending was super wholesome but it was too wholesome / felt rushed yaknow? But I like that you don't know if it's real or just a story","2021-09-23 03:01:05",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","I just think WWRD? 😛

I read a some of the Subreddit stuff and people are throwing mad shade sayin it's cultish - btw did you know it's owned by Disney?! #conspiracy haha 

Def agree the ending didn't match the complexity of the rest of the show - didn't do the show justice! What if Francis wrote the ending and what if everyone actually did die in the fire! I liked how they left the ending up for your interpretation too 🤫 Ep 7 was probs my fav ","2021-09-23 03:13:31",,
"Me","","Ya that's a good lens to analyze stuff through, I'll try to spend 4-5 seconds to contemplate that in the future 😛

I did not know Disney owned it!!! They have their fingers in so many pots these days - maybe there'll be a 9PS ride at Disney land one of these days haha - they can just give all the adults shrooms before going on the it's-a-small-world ride

The fire death would be v messed up! Lit yet not lit at the same time 🔥 If Francis' fairy tale ending didn't happen to everybody else, where do you think they'd actually be rn?

I have a goldfish memory and can't really remember what happens episode to episode, it all kinda blurs together for me 😭 but I liked the early episodes with the wholesome character interactions and banter!","2021-09-23 13:02:04",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","WWRD was successful for Francis and Tony - so it must work 😤

If I was served the 9PS special at Disneyland I'd have to experience Space Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, and the firework show 😏

I like the ending Francis wrote for everyone 🥺 I wouldn't want it any other way tbh, wbu? 

I have a goldfish memory too! I blame my short attention span 🤭 I only remember ep 7 for that shocking ending when Carmel exposes herself! (I have to look up the characters' name bc my goldfish memory is so bad 💀) wholesome connections and banter is the cocktail of most of my fav shows now that I think about it 🤔

Ya I think it was cute, everything worked out so perfectly (but by saying that you're implying it's not the real ending 👀) 

Yay fellow goldfish! Ok ya fair enough it is hard to forget when she put the contact in! I still do not remember the Insta couple's names and it took me long time for Delilah! Also that is crucial info, I'll keep it in mind when finishing up the show recommender 😉

My work day had (has 😩) no time for jams today, just lots of meetings/interviews, but I will jam to it in solidarity with you tonight!!

Did you get some 🔥 interviews - any potential Matt Jrs?! I'm sure you got all the MIT cuties dying for a 1-on-1 😉 Good thing the album also works for chill night vibez! Lmk what you think 🧐 

I have the album on vinyl so id rate it pretty high 😍 but don't let my luv for it be a bias!

In my last interview of the day, when I was super pooped, ready to talk to candidate for 60 minutes, the candidate started by saying he already accepted another job, so I was free!! Some prospective Matt Jrs in the works, we'll see how they do! I promise there are no cuties at the hackathon haha just a lot of tech bros (who are cute in their own way 😛) word on the street is that slo is the place to find cuties 😉

I liked Bones' flow a lot, also I think I'm gonna need to learn the guitar on I won't lie! Also the bossa nova vibe on any day will do fine is 😘👌 so many lil sub genres between songs!

"Caitlin","2132487674","True but the Marconi's and Masha were the only ones not ""in the fire"" and both of their happy endings involved them driving away in a car. So maybe they are the only ones who actually left Tranquillum house. Maybe Francis wrote everyone's endings before the fire?   

Oooo ok good! I wonder if you can build the program to lead me to pick the show you really want somehow 😉

SLO has some cuties 🍊 only one way to find out - maybe I could introduce you to some sometime 😉 

Biking thru the city late at night w this album is big main character energy! Bones is one of my fav songs along w rest and home again. I'd like to redeem one of my Diplomatts super fan perks - mini desk concert asap 👀 

If you dig this Kiwanuka stuff check out Piano Joint and Cold Little Heart!

Haha I've never heard the term main character energy but I like it 😎 uh oh I'll have to see what I can do, maybe that'll be my weekend protect 👀 

I'm queuing those two right now! Ya let's keep our ears peeled for the samples on the next Tyler album 👂 also it would be a great honor to co-write a review, but I'm not sure if my musical insights could hold up to yours, especially with you being an ex-broadway musician 😉","2021-09-24 19:15:19",,

Woohoo let's go OR 😤 a fellow main character 😉

How did baby Caitlin evolve through AM? Also it took me an embarrassingly long time back in the day to realize the waves on the album art were like AM radio waves (and also that it's an abbreviation for Arctic monkeys 🤯)","2021-09-25 16:59:30",,

I'm going to humble myself and admit I also wasn't aware of these things about AM for awhile - you're not alone🥵 this was one of the first vinyls I owned so I have a lot of good, nostalgic, overwhelming happiness when I listen to it.

I'm sure you'll get all the cool artists! 

Ya I think full album listens aren't a big thing anymore rip - but that also means artists aren't as incentivised to make filler songs to make a big album I think, so there are little tradeoffs I guess 🤷

Ya lost in the world is a super pretty song, I really like the soundscape it has!!

Also I learned the intro to I Won't Lie! A micro desk concert, full 14 seconds of content 😛","2021-09-27 01:58:20",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","You're doing it the good ol fashioned way I guess 😎

You're def onto something there - in addition to the pressures of finishing an album just to meet deadlines😭 but on the other hand I think streaming has made artists more focused on releasing singles instead of working on longer projects! I'm team albums all the way 🥺 that's just me selfishly wanting more content tho 🙊 

Lost in the world is the underdog track of the album for sure 😎

I just thought of another no skip/ soundscapey album- Cirlces by Mac Miller! It literally flows from start to finish and back to start in a perfect circle (hense its title) 😛

How long did it take you to learn that on your guitar?! If you ever release a Matt's Minidesk EP and need cover art lmk 😎

Ya that's a classic! I've never given it a full listen through, but I just did and ya the soundscape is on point! Also ya look at you go with these album title introspections!!! I think IGOR has a really good soundscape but it's a few tracks short of being no skip IMO 😭 I've been listening to this with no skips a lot yesterday/today, big fan of acoustic covers + covers of other artists' work! https://open.spotify.com/album/4zpN41aGAYPWX3dzE19rH7?si=-VEKZ5TWRcy448j2OlpOjg&utm_source=copy-link&dl_branch=1

That was my first impression of Igor! It is a perfect example of an album that doesn't have many ""singles"" but proves that it's a better album than most bc of it! Hot take- When artists aren't motivated by popularizing their singles they produce better records 😎

OMG I love cage the elephant!!! The accustom version of Right Before My Eyes hits different 🥺 they are def on my concert bucket list! If ya like CTE you may like this playlist (shuffle is ok here ;) https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5JH7IG7BuvgWyDlFLXmXbb?si=SUUMA9IAToemFmONDXp-SQ&dl_branch=1

That is deep - sounds like you've gotta show the world the Annie production it's been missing #practiceWhatYouPreach 😉 I used to play a lot at open mic with my friends in college, but I don't think the band will be getting back together, we live very far away from each other now 😭

Uh oh, I'll have to talk to the person behind this algorithm, sounds like he's got some work to do 😛 yes very thoughtful of you retaking it to get the full experience haha - ok so what's the final verdict??

Wow how could the algorithm not like you 😉 I've seen AHS and Dave, but pretty long ago, so down to rewatch! Also just looked up 11.22.63, looks super cool as well, down to check it out too! I'll let you make the final decision 😉

I kinda like that soundtrack, lots of funky sounds! It reminds me of another soundtrack from a show called Utopia! And surprise surprise it's the same composer!!

Uhh there may or may not be an unlisted video out there but the price of admission isn't cheap!! The going exchange rate is one open mic video for one Broadway song 👀👀👀 yes hopefully your discerning senses of sight and sound won't be too thrown off by the vid 😉

Ya AHS is good for spooky season! Also thank you for giving me a softball question, obviously we start at S1! The seasons have lil references to each other sometimes, so we gotta start at the beginning!!

I really liked white lotus!! So chaotic, such a good cast of characters! Somehow, even though it's much more realistic, I get more shook from that than from 9ps - I ended on ep 5 and it feels like quite the cliffhanger, I almost wanna go back on the plane so I can finish the season!

Ooo that is a real bargain, you know how to really negotiate 😜 I guess I'll just have find a way to hack the yt acct to see it 🥸

I was testing you and congrats you passed! You really hit it out of the park w that one ⚾️ I've seen a few AHS eps throughout the years but never invested time into a whole season so I'm excited! 

I loveeee white lotus a lil more I think- I can't quite put my finger on exactly why yet, but I think it has something to do w the amount of shookness & tension🧐 each character represents a REAL archetype - which makes it interesting to see how they act in certain situations / interact w each other! This tension is v similar to 9PS! I think Armand is funny af, Rachel is too nice for her own good, I absolutely hate her husband Shane, and Olivia gives me serial killer vibes 👀 wbu?!

Ya the archetypes are so real - I think the old lady (I'm horrible at names) is so accurate, they're beyond annoying but you still feel for them a lil 😞 also I was physically cringing on the plane with a lot of the character interactions! Armand putting the couple on the boat with the old lady had me dead 💀 and ya rip Rachel, surrounded by big meanies everywhere 😭 and ya Olivia really has no redeeming qualities - I think my fav moment from the show was when Quinn rowed the boat, v wholesome content, so good thing she made him sleep on the beach I guess 🤷 No no all of our chatting only helped immerse me even quicker into the wonderful world of tranquilum 😎 quite the good show rec #5senses","2021-09-29 10:38:24",,

You can handle more spook than I thought! Would you say you like AHS or AHS's more?! Also- Have you seen the Haunting of Hill House or the Haunting of Bly Manor on Netflix? They've come out w S3 of a (not) related series and ep 1 is 👀 👀 I highly recommend it - if you can handle it 😉

Ok ok download the album Bambi by Hippo Campus 🤩 its another no skip album that's also soundscapey - perf for dreamy flights 😌

No no AHS is spook-lite! I tried to watch the first of those shows but could not get into it at all, idk why - you can spoil it for me, but were the ghosts actually real?? Or were they metaphors for their haunted family history / feelings??

Now you have me hyped up, I'll bump Bambi tomorrow! Please tell me there's a song with a big bass called Thumper 😛

Also I've definitely listened to the title track on Bambi before! Also you gotta respect their pun game! In college, my band went by the name ""pretty mediocre"" so when we went on stage we would say ""hi, we're pretty mediocre""

Yes hippo campus is a band of ~intellectuals~ but they've got nothin on pretty mediocre 😉 what did you think of the album?!

I liked it a lot! Bambi was a big fav obv, but the beat on doubt was really cool too! Good soundscape! No no pretty mediocre was... pretty mediocre 😛 maybe one day the band will get back together 😩

Update working on PST makes it hard to go to TJs but I went to a nice icecream place instead and had a nice pumpkin cheesecake ice cream! Also they had a whole vegan menu, you would've been in heaven! But anything with pumpkin spice in the name sounds v good, I'll keep an eye out for those too! When I checked out from TJs the cashier recommended them! You should carpe cheesebites!

Ya my one friend is hella connected - we met a bunch of casual millionaires, then hung with my other friend who is crashing at another millionaire's place, he had this giant pixar lamp, it was whack (I took pics lemme find one to send) - also one of the millionaires invited me to his place in presidio for tea #socialclimbing

"Me","","Soggy bottoms sounds very nefarious haha - I guess I'll have to watch to understand the context 💦 👖 

Wow I have not listened to black eyed peas in so long! We did karaoke last night but nobody added that banger to the playlist 😩

Having an alias is peak humility! Can't be bothered with all the glitz and glam from the 🔥 reviews you'll drop! No snitching I promise 🙊 I think if I had to do an alias, I'd make it an anagram of my name bc I like word games and stuff like that, but that might be too ez to decode 😩

My goal in life is to have a big lamp like this guy - I don't envy the moving guys who had to get it into his apartment tho

Ya gotta find my Sunday best flannel hahaha - the guy seems a lil unhinged but that just means I can literally drink tea while I get the tea 🍵 also he blends his own tea so how can I resist

Another hot take I think guac is just a lil overrated 👀 are you a guacaholic?? Do you put them on your apple nachos?

Woohoo more hoodies!! That means the odds of mine getting stolen decreases right 👀 Any designs in particular? I wanna make embroidered hoodies for my team but I think it'd be too rough to do that volume by hand 😥

Wow way to spoil it for me 😠 

A great uno card player never reveals her tricks 🎩 🐇 that is a good tip tho, thank you for helping level the playing field 🙇

Haha yes ofc ofc, work is the highlight of my day 😛 I'll check out the ep after I check out my discover weekly (based on the first few songs, it's not that promising 👀) - as usual I've been slacking on my playlist adds 😩

Also how are you handling the fb/insta outage? I noticed my discover weekly no longer has my fb profile pic in it, quite the casualty 💀","2021-10-04 16:50:13",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","Going to the movies is one of my fav things ever - and The Alamo is the best theatre I've ever been too! They've got an older vibe (more character obv) also you can order food and craft alc and they bring it to your seat! Their menu is often customized based on the showing😍 when I saw frozen I got a fun blue cocktail 🍸 I break veganism for their good eats 🤤 

We gotta be like RiRi and 🎶 work, work, work, work, work 🎶 haha I only got a few jams from my discover weekly, nothing good enough for our 9PSS playlist tho - I've got high standards for us 😉

Yenno the world did stop spinning for a bit while everything was down! But good thing I still had TikTok and Snapchat 😛 do you think it had something to do w the whistleblower from fb coming forward yesterday?!

"Me","","A true patron of the fine arts!! I can tell because you spelled theater the British way 😉 pinkies up for class! Alamo sounds lit tho, big fan of the vintage aesthetic!! If you ever wanna postpone our steadfast Wednesday tradition (sacrilege, I know 😤) for a movie night at Alamo, lemme know, I'd be super down!

I found one candidate for the summer banger playlist! But yet to find something to fit 9PS's one of a kind vibe (I'll keep my ears peeled tho)!! And of course, nothing but the best for us and our playlists 😤 you've got spoti-fine taste!

I am not a tiktokker myself 👴 but my friend said he couldn't log into tiktok because the FB auth was down! Snap and SMS are the only services that matter to me 😉 although I'm sure Blake was sad she couldn't paw-st on the gram! I honestly could buy that conspiracy - maybe they wanna delete a bunch of internal stuff and had to take server down for it?? I'm usually not a big conspiracy guy but I could totally see this happening!","2021-10-05 00:46:18",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","Haha Miz Drama Prez has gotta keep it real 🎭 I'm super down for the Alamo but since I picked the place I'll let you pick the time and get back to me 😉 I need all the Halloween content I can get ASAP!! 

We've got Spoti-fine taste 😛 our blend still hasn't changed much, im gonna bump some chaotic playlists today - beware 😈

Snap and SMS are the only thing that really matters to me but Blake would bark to differ, she's starting to become more active 👀 watch out! 

Mercury is in retrograde 🔮😉 I don't really buy into conspiracy unironically buuuut this is really fun to think about!

"Me","","Ooh you drive a hard bargain mz pres! I think the halloweeniest movie they're showing tomorrow is Venom - are you down for that at 7:10pm? I'll snag tickets if so!

Bring the chaos, our blend needs an awakening! I'll join you in listening to some avant garde picks 😉 (although my discover weekly is trying its hardest on that front anyways 😛)

Mercury in retrograde is one of my favorite sayings! I use that, or say there were solar flares, whenever my code breaks at work 😛 Ya conspiracies are fun - one of the guys at my work was really getting into UFOs and started monologuing on them for a while (everybody else in the call was like 👀😳🗿) - and ya the employee instigated FB sabotage would be preeetty spicy 🌶 🍵 Apparently their internal tools didn't work either so they had to communicate via email - oh the horror!","2021-10-05 15:03:44",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","Yes Venom at 7 sounds perf 😻I hope it's not full already! lmk how much so I can Venmo ◡̈ 

I've gotta say Spotify has disappointed me w our Blend! I feel like the songs don't change enough - maybe I'm demanding to much 😅 I've been sooo obsessed w this song https://open.spotify.com/track/4dGuRldChjvboZktprNJFM?si=w0tv9JRbSXmmKg1cK6gkdg&dl_branch=1

Omg did he think the earth is flat too? 😜 tbh I do enjoy hearing their logic to see how they draw their conclusions - im all for a big imagination 🤯 yeah I want to believe it was more than just a coincidence, it was v Snowden of her to come forward👀 a tru patriot!! I can't wait for the corporate espionage docs/dramas to come out about this🤓 I'd also be happy if some hackers were just waiting for the right time to strike 👻 fb doesn't use slack their missing out on those infamous reacts #partyparrot no wonder why everyone there is no fun! 😉","2021-10-05 19:06:23",,"http://63.55.1.87/servlets/mms?message-id=0FF3D6885E6E0000ED20000201"
"Me","","Woohoo, booked!! See ya then 😎 

I think I wasn't spotifying too much in nyc but now that I'm back here hopefully blend will have more content to work with! Makes sense that your spotify bar is high given all of the 🔥 tracks in our playlists 😉 I like the lil drops in that song, very groovy, head is bobbing nonstop! 

He did not unfortunately 😩 Ya whenever I hear somebody say something I disagree with (or sometimes ppl I do agree with) I just ask them to clarify more and more! I think it's a good way to understand other ppls viewpoints, and eventually they can't clarify anymore and get stumped 😈

Ya maybe she could do a cover of the AHS song with all the whistleblowing she's doing 😗💨 Netflix docudramas are my fav, but it's also crazy how much they can influence public opinion based on the spin they put in a docuseries! 

If FB ever does custom reacts, their stock would 2x ez - when they added custom reacts to messenger, the world stood still!!","2021-10-05 22:10:17",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","Ahhh thanks for securing the tickets 😍 Don't forget your vaccination card! I'm bringing mine just in case 😎 

Head bobbing af!! Haha I listen to it a few times a day - everything still woozy touches turns to gold 😜 did you and your friend ever record that song? That would def be a good addition to the playlist 😉

Ooo sneaky but a much kinder response I like it 🧐 That's a good strategy for debates as well! You'll catch some people hearing the flaws in their own logic if you're lucky 🤯can't wait until you use that on me 😜 

Now that's an idea - you should be her agent 😉Yes so much media manipulates people these days! I love a good docuseries and docudramas - do you have any favs? 

Do you use fb?! 😶","2021-10-06 00:31:41",,"http://63.55.128.103/servlets/mms?message-id=07F3DB13C1410000AD10000201"
"Me","","I've got a vax card pic! I used to keep mine in my wallet, but when I got my second shot the vax lady roasted me so now I keep it at home 😩

We did not :((( my roommate also used to have a soundcloud tho, v musical acquaintances! Also yes still woozy is the man, have you heard of scary pockets? They do pretty neat covers, I was bumping some of them today! But also my roommate and I started talking about punk music so we listened to a lot of that, we'll see if our blend stays resilient or not 👀

I would never use it on you! You will just say something and I'll say ""no further questions your honor"" and that'll be that haha

I watched one called the devil we know, about dupont chemical - also I like true crime stuff too! The great minds behind AHS released American Crime Story, where they dramatize true crime! The assassination of Versace one was really good!!

I mostly use FB for messenger, which is how I talk to most of my friends! Also FB is pretty good for events too! For instance, there's an Olivia Rodrigo + Taylor Swift themed night at a bar pretty soon 😛 Sometimes I find myself mindlessly scrolling through tho 👀 so I've since uninstalled the app (also uninstalled insta!) but I still find myself typing the address in chrome every once in a while 😩 wbu?","2021-10-06 02:25:45",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","What did she roast you about? 😱 I get nervous and think they won't take the pic for value 😭 that's nice you and your roommate can jam out together during the work day! Do you guys use the Spotify party tool or have a cool speaker set up? 

I'll check out scary pockets today 😎 we should def see it in our blend if we both listen to it! 

I would actually be v impressed haha I'm always down for a challenging convo - I'm sure only good things will come out of it 😉

I like true crime too! I know you're not big into podcasts but there's this one about the disappearance of a Cal Poly student that's really really good bc it's an open case rn! 

Omg that OL + TS night sounds soooo fun, you know the karaoke will be good! thank goodness for fb or else no one would know 😜 I am guilty of scrolling on the fb timelines every know and then, and do use it as a scrapbook to keep all my OG fans up to date w life events 😇 Hot take MySpace> Facebook ","2021-10-06 13:16:04",,"http://63.55.128.103/servlets/mms?message-id=07F3E5C15F2900002CE0000201"
"Me","","The cards are bigger than wallets so mine got smooshed and she was like ""this will not do, writing you a new card"" 💀 We don't usually jam during workday but sometimes at night we just chill on couch and listen to stuff! He has an xbox + sound bar that we can play to for maximal jams 😤

Yes we must force the blend to learn! Still waiting for its daily update 😠

I'll keep that in mind 😉 next time you roast olivia rodrigo I might resort to these tactics 😈

I feel like I just don't have the attention span for podcasts / can't listen to them while working either 😩 do the cal poly podcasters have that silky smooth radio voice tho?

Yes Mr. Zuck personally blessed my newsfeed with that content 🙏 FB scrapbook is very wholesome, I approve! I think I wasn't as cool as young Caitlin, since I never had a myspace 😞 but I did have a Google Buzz, that was the go to social network (before Google+ killed it 😠) - one day when spotify listens to your suggestions, they'll claim their rightful title as the best, most wholesome social media platform!","2021-10-06 16:44:51",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","At least she was trying to be helpful! Mine is pretty worn in but I feel like that's a flex 💪🏼 sound bar sounds v lit 🔥 I'll know I've peaked once I have a whole room dedicated for just music listen parties 🎧 

Yes you must defend ya girl OR to the grave 😤😤😤

I totally feel you, it's so hard for me to follow podcasts sometimes but I'm extra invested in this podcast bc a lot takes place on the central coast and on campus! The host actually is some dude in his 30s w a nice voice! Not asmr level - but he's brought more attention to the case and the community is a lot more involved bc of it! I'm v invested 

Yes we have Mr.Zuck to thank for these 10/10 events 🤩 haha idk if I'd call MySpace cool or cringe bc idk what info I had to share w the world at 11 years old 😜 my tumblr was a different story tho 😎 haha I've never heard of Google Buzz!

Ya makes sense! I wonder if the host practices his radio voice or if it comes naturally 🤔

Yes Mark hosts them himself, what a gracious CEO 😻 what was on your tumblr?? I will update my offer, willing to trade gambino YouTube video for a glimpse into young Caitlin's tumblr, I can let you know if it's cool or cringe 😉","2021-10-06 20:34:05",,

Ofc, we'll make a boba convert out of you yet! Lucky for you I know a good boba spot near us 😉

6 hours too many imo 😱 at least you can do them from your bed instead of at the office?!? I hope lol

* Jazz bar (good bc we don't need to wait till the weekend to hang / can do it after work - but also for the culture / drinks 🍹🍸🍻)
* Museums! SF MoMA is on my to-see list, but down for whatever! Would be cute weekend thing, also good for playlist album art inspo 😍

I'm also going climbing Thursday with some buds after work (they are all pretty new to climbing) if you wanna tag along, good a c t i v e date so we can justify eating oatly ice cream after 😉

"Me","","Yes we can revisit the calculations with the scientific method - we'll need repeated trials 😉

I'm down for dinner there! Also wow so much pressure 😩 let's pray for no -5/10s this time

My buddy Logan, we used to work together and then he quit to do his own crypto startup! Here's a pic of him DJing our Tahoe party - he likes music so he's gotta be a reliable source 😉

Haha yes those are true hot takes #menaretrash - I love the music in the background too 💀 Did you ever give your hot take tho 🤔","2021-10-19 12:17:41",,

What's his crypto start up?! I def trust Logan if he's a crypto DJ genius, and a friend of yours 😽 

I won't hesitate to let you know when I have a hot take 😉

Going into the office before 1:30 should be illegal 😜 I was up by 7 today 💀

It's just him right now! Not sure if he's settled on an idea yet tho, but I believe in him, he's v entrepreneurial #business

Yes please send the hot takes this way 🔥

Yes ofc, he wanted me to do ""meme marketing"" and webdev for him a while back, we'll see how that goes 👀

No I didn't notice your tossing and turning at all! But there were some other things you did that kept me up 😉😘

Woohoo put on your sherlock holmes hat, detective Caitlin is on the job 🕵️‍♀️ a secret tunnel under the park would be super cool!

Yes I am happy to embezzle tickets for VIP status 😎 (even though you are equally very important 😘) - I'm one movie night away from leveling up! Also thanks in advance for dinner bøws you are too kind!! So excited to rewatch Venom with you tomorrow 😈","2021-10-20 00:32:12",,

Oh no not the fav tshirt 😱 maybe they'll have it at lost and found or something?? This is so tragic, what was on the shirt?? You can replace it with my striped shirt if you need ❤

The puns are back, and they rock 🪨 and yes, it's called Venom 2 because you have to watch it 2 times for it to be good #math 😉 Also ya the good thing about Alamo is that it'll be harder for us to get distracted by eachother 😉 (instead we can get distracted by the yummy food!!)

Frat star Caitlin, prepared for the yakking! Apple sauce definitely hits the spot after a long night over the toilet (also Gatorade for those e l e c t r o l y t e s 😤)  Also noooo not the bathroom sleep rip - I remember I had a really bad throw up night, and I just accepted my fate and brought a blanket and pillow into the bathroom (not the pillow on my bed rn I promise 😘) - but glad you are feeling better again!! What's your go-to sick day hobby?

Tomorrow we'll have some nice vegan snacks, no yakking or bathroom sleeping, just (mostly) wholesome bed cuddles 😘","2021-10-21 21:22:39",,
"Caitlin","2132487674","Yeah maybe I should do my part and avoid black dresses! For the environment of course 😘 but if I do my part you gotta do yours! That means no more cute haircuts - think of the icebergs! 

I've def pulled the bathroom sleepover w blankets and pillows before as well. Nothing more comforting than a camping trip in your bathroom! Gatorade is best enjoyed ice cold preferably any blue or orange flavors! Do you have a fav? Also popsicles and ramen noodles in a cup are the only things that ever sound good to me when I'm like dis 😭 do you have a fav Gatorade flavor? When I was younger I had a free for all w cartoons and cereal (w my similar comfort sick food - something's never change 😜) but now my activities are hot baths, cuddling in bed, and drinking lots of hot tea!

I had a cocktail with a popsicle in it, 10/10 life-changing experience 😋 Lemme know if you need cuddle help 😘 I haven't had a bath in so long #showergang - ya hot drinks are overrated, hot chocolate is the only ok one tbh 😤
